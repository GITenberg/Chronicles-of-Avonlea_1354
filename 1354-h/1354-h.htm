    <h2>
      I. The Hurrying of Ludovic
    </h2>
    <p>
      Anne Shirley was curled up on the window-seat of Theodora Dix&rsquo;s
      sitting-room one Saturday evening, looking dreamily afar at some fair
      starland beyond the hills of sunset. Anne was visiting for a fortnight of
      her vacation at Echo Lodge, where Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Irving were
      spending the summer, and she often ran over to the old Dix homestead to
      chat for awhile with Theodora. They had had their chat out, on this
      particular evening, and Anne was giving herself over to the delight of
      building an air-castle. She leaned her shapely head, with its braided
      coronet of dark red hair, against the window-casing, and her gray eyes
      were like the moonlight gleam of shadowy pools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she saw Ludovic Speed coming down the lane. He was yet far from the
      house, for the Dix lane was a long one, but Ludovic could be recognized as
      far as he could be seen. No one else in Middle Grafton had such a tall,
      gently-stooping, placidly-moving figure. In every kink and turn of it
      there was an individuality all Ludovic&rsquo;s own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne roused herself from her dreams, thinking it would only be tactful to
      take her departure. Ludovic was courting Theodora. Everyone in Grafton
      knew that, or, if anyone were in ignorance of the fact, it was not because
      he had not had time to find out. Ludovic had been coming down that lane to
      see Theodora, in the same ruminating, unhastening fashion, for fifteen
      years!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Anne, who was slim and girlish and romantic, rose to go, Theodora,
      who was plump and middle-aged and practical, said, with a twinkle in her
      eye:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any hurry, child. Sit down and have your call out. You&rsquo;ve
      seen Ludovic coming down the lane, and, I suppose, you think you&rsquo;ll be a
      crowd. But you won&rsquo;t. Ludovic rather likes a third person around, and so
      do I. It spurs up the conversation as it were. When a man has been coming
      to see you straight along, twice a week for fifteen years, you get rather
      talked out by spells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodora never pretended to bashfulness where Ludovic was concerned. She
      was not at all shy of referring to him and his dilatory courtship. Indeed,
      it seemed to amuse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne sat down again and together they watched Ludovic coming down the
      lane, gazing calmly about him at the lush clover fields and the blue loops
      of the river winding in and out of the misty valley below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked at Theodora&rsquo;s placid, finely-moulded face and tried to imagine
      what she herself would feel like if she were sitting there, waiting for an
      elderly lover who had, seemingly, taken so long to make up his mind. But
      even Anne&rsquo;s imagination failed her for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she thought, impatiently, &ldquo;if I wanted him I think I&rsquo;d find some
      way of hurrying him up. Ludovic SPEED! Was there ever such a misfit of a
      name? Such a name for such a man is a delusion and a snare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently Ludovic got to the house, but stood so long on the doorstep in a
      brown study, gazing into the tangled green boskage of the cherry orchard,
      that Theodora finally went and opened the door before he knocked. As she
      brought him into the sitting-room she made a comical grimace at Anne over
      his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ludovic smiled pleasantly at Anne. He liked her; she was the only young
      girl he knew, for he generally avoided young girls&mdash;they made him
      feel awkward and out of place. But Anne did not affect him in this
      fashion. She had a way of getting on with all sorts of people, and,
      although they had not known her very long, both Ludovic and Theodora
      looked upon her as an old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ludovic was tall and somewhat ungainly, but his unhesitating placidity
      gave him the appearance of a dignity that did not otherwise pertain to
      him. He had a drooping, silky, brown moustache, and a little curly tuft of
      imperial,&mdash;a fashion which was regarded as eccentric in Grafton,
      where men had clean-shaven chins or went full-bearded. His eyes were
      dreamy and pleasant, with a touch of melancholy in their blue depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in the big bulgy old armchair that had belonged to Theodora&rsquo;s
      father. Ludovic always sat there, and Anne declared that the chair had
      come to look like him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation soon grew animated enough. Ludovic was a good talker when
      he had somebody to draw him out. He was well read, and frequently
      surprised Anne by his shrewd comments on men and matters out in the world,
      of which only the faint echoes reached Deland River. He had also a liking
      for religious arguments with Theodora, who did not care much for politics
      or the making of history, but was avid of doctrines, and read everything
      pertaining thereto. When the conversation drifted into an eddy of friendly
      wrangling between Ludovic and Theodora over Christian Science, Anne
      understood that her usefulness was ended for the time being, and that she
      would not be missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s star time and good-night time,&rdquo; she said, and went away quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had to stop to laugh when she was well out of sight of the house,
      in a green meadow bestarred with the white and gold of daisies. A wind,
      odour-freighted, blew daintily across it. Anne leaned against a white
      birch tree in the corner and laughed heartily, as she was apt to do
      whenever she thought of Ludovic and Theodora. To her eager youth, this
      courtship of theirs seemed a very amusing thing. She liked Ludovic, but
      allowed herself to be provoked with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear, big, irritating goose!&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;There never was such a
      lovable idiot before. He&rsquo;s just like the alligator in the old rhyme, who
      wouldn&rsquo;t go along, and wouldn&rsquo;t keep still, but just kept bobbing up and
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two evenings later, when Anne went over to the Dix place, she and Theodora
      drifted into a conversation about Ludovic. Theodora, who was the most
      industrious soul alive, and had a mania for fancy work into the bargain,
      was busying her smooth, plump fingers with a very elaborate Battenburg
      lace centre-piece. Anne was lying back in a little rocker, with her slim
      hands folded in her lap, watching Theodora. She realized that Theodora was
      very handsome, in a stately, Juno-like fashion of firm, white flesh,
      large, clearly-chiselled outlines, and great, cowey, brown eyes. When
      Theodora was not smiling, she looked very imposing. Anne thought it likely
      that Ludovic held her in awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you and Ludovic talk about Christian Science ALL Saturday evening?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora overflowed into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and we even quarrelled over it. At least <i>I</i> did. Ludovic
      wouldn&rsquo;t quarrel with anyone. You have to fight air when you spar with
      him. I hate to square up to a person who won&rsquo;t hit back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodora,&rdquo; said Anne coaxingly, &ldquo;I am going to be curious and
      impertinent. You can snub me if you like. Why don&rsquo;t you and Ludovic get
      married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodora laughed comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question Grafton folks have been asking for quite a while, I
      reckon, Anne. Well, I&rsquo;d have no objection to marrying Ludovic. That&rsquo;s
      frank enough for you, isn&rsquo;t it? But it&rsquo;s not easy to marry a man unless he
      asks you. And Ludovic has never asked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he too shy?&rdquo; persisted Anne. Since Theodora was in the mood, she meant
      to sift this puzzling affair to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora dropped her work and looked meditatively out over the green
      slopes of the summer world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think it is that. Ludovic isn&rsquo;t shy. It&rsquo;s just his way&mdash;the
      Speed way. The Speeds are all dreadfully deliberate. They spend years
      thinking over a thing before they make up their minds to do it. Sometimes
      they get so much in the habit of thinking about it that they never get
      over it&mdash;like old Alder Speed, who was always talking of going to
      England to see his brother, but never went, though there was no earthly
      reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re not lazy, you know, but they love to take
      their time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Ludovic is just an aggravated case of Speedism,&rdquo; suggested Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. He never hurried in his life. Why, he has been thinking for the
      last six years of getting his house painted. He talks it over with me
      every little while, and picks out the colour, and there the matter stays.
      He&rsquo;s fond of me, and he means to ask me to have him sometime. The only
      question is&mdash;will the time ever come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you hurry him up?&rdquo; asked Anne impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora went back to her stitches with another laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Ludovic could be hurried up, I&rsquo;m not the one to do it. I&rsquo;m too shy. It
      sounds ridiculous to hear a woman of my age and inches say that, but it is
      true. Of course, I know it&rsquo;s the only way any Speed ever did make out to
      get married. For instance, there&rsquo;s a cousin of mine married to Ludovic&rsquo;s
      brother. I don&rsquo;t say she proposed to him out and out, but, mind you, Anne,
      it wasn&rsquo;t far from it. I couldn&rsquo;t do anything like that. I DID try once.
      When I realized that I was getting sere and mellow, and all the girls of
      my generation were going off on either hand, I tried to give Ludovic a
      hint. But it stuck in my throat. And now I don&rsquo;t mind. If I don&rsquo;t change
      Dix to Speed until I take the initiative, it will be Dix to the end of
      life. Ludovic doesn&rsquo;t realize that we are growing old, you know. He thinks
      we are giddy young folks yet, with plenty of time before us. That&rsquo;s the
      Speed failing. They never find out they&rsquo;re alive until they&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fond of Ludovic, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Anne, detecting a note of real
      bitterness among Theodora&rsquo;s paradoxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws, yes,&rdquo; said Theodora candidly. She did not think it worth while to
      blush over so settled a fact. &ldquo;I think the world and all of Ludovic. And
      he certainly does need somebody to look after HIM. He&rsquo;s neglected&mdash;he
      looks frayed. You can see that for yourself. That old aunt of his looks
      after his house in some fashion, but she doesn&rsquo;t look after him. And he&rsquo;s
      coming now to the age when a man needs to be looked after and coddled a
      bit. I&rsquo;m lonesome here, and Ludovic is lonesome up there, and it does seem
      ridiculous, doesn&rsquo;t it? I don&rsquo;t wonder that we&rsquo;re the standing joke of
      Grafton. Goodness knows, I laugh at it enough myself. I&rsquo;ve sometimes
      thought that if Ludovic could be made jealous it might spur him along. But
      I never could flirt and there&rsquo;s nobody to flirt with if I could. Everybody
      hereabouts looks upon me as Ludovic&rsquo;s property and nobody would dream of
      interfering with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodora,&rdquo; cried Anne, &ldquo;I have a plan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what are you going to do?&rdquo; exclaimed Theodora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne told her. At first Theodora laughed and protested. In the end, she
      yielded somewhat doubtfully, overborne by Anne&rsquo;s enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, try it, then,&rdquo; she said, resignedly. &ldquo;If Ludovic gets mad and
      leaves me, I&rsquo;ll be worse off than ever. But nothing venture, nothing win.
      And there is a fighting chance, I suppose. Besides, I must admit I&rsquo;m tired
      of his dilly-dallying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne went back to Echo Lodge tingling with delight in her plot. She hunted
      up Arnold Sherman, and told him what was required of him. Arnold Sherman
      listened and laughed. He was an elderly widower, an intimate friend of
      Stephen Irving, and had come down to spend part of the summer with him and
      his wife in Prince Edward Island. He was handsome in a mature style, and
      he had a dash of mischief in him still, so that he entered readily enough
      into Anne&rsquo;s plan. It amused him to think of hurrying Ludovic Speed, and he
      knew that Theodora Dix could be depended on to do her part. The comedy
      would not be dull, whatever its outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain rose on the first act after prayer meeting on the next
      Thursday night. It was bright moonlight when the people came out of
      church, and everybody saw it plainly. Arnold Sherman stood upon the steps
      close to the door, and Ludovic Speed leaned up against a corner of the
      graveyard fence, as he had done for years. The boys said he had worn the
      paint off that particular place. Ludovic knew of no reason why he should
      paste himself up against the church door. Theodora would come out as
      usual, and he would join her as she went past the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was what happened, Theodora came down the steps, her stately figure
      outlined in its darkness against the gush of lamplight from the porch.
      Arnold Sherman asked her if he might see her home. Theodora took his arm
      calmly, and together they swept past the stupefied Ludovic, who stood
      helplessly gazing after them as if unable to believe his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments he stood there limply; then he started down the road
      after his fickle lady and her new admirer. The boys and irresponsible
      young men crowded after, expecting some excitement, but they were
      disappointed. Ludovic strode on until he overtook Theodora and Arnold
      Sherman, and then fell meekly in behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora hardly enjoyed her walk home, although Arnold Sherman laid
      himself out to be especially entertaining. Her heart yearned after
      Ludovic, whose shuffling footsteps she heard behind her. She feared that
      she had been very cruel, but she was in for it now. She steeled herself by
      the reflection that it was all for his own good, and she talked to Arnold
      Sherman as if he were the one man in the world. Poor, deserted Ludovic,
      following humbly behind, heard her, and if Theodora had known how bitter
      the cup she was holding to his lips really was, she would never have been
      resolute enough to present it, no matter for what ultimate good.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she and Arnold turned in at her gate, Ludovic had to stop. Theodora
      looked over her shoulder and saw him standing still on the road. His
      forlorn figure haunted her thoughts all night. If Anne had not run over
      the next day and bolstered up her convictions, she might have spoiled
      everything by prematurely relenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ludovic, meanwhile, stood still on the road, quite oblivious to the hoots
      and comments of the vastly amused small boy contingent, until Theodora and
      his rival disappeared from his view under the firs in the hollow of her
      lane. Then he turned about and went home, not with his usual leisurely
      amble, but with a perturbed stride which proclaimed his inward disquiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt bewildered. If the world had come suddenly to an end or if the
      lazy, meandering Grafton River had turned about and flowed up hill,
      Ludovic could not have been more astonished. For fifteen years he had
      walked home from meetings with Theodora; and now this elderly stranger,
      with all the glamour of &ldquo;the States&rdquo; hanging about him, had coolly walked
      off with her under Ludovic&rsquo;s very nose. Worse&mdash;most unkindest cut of
      all&mdash;Theodora had gone with him willingly; nay, she had evidently
      enjoyed his company. Ludovic felt the stirring of a righteous anger in his
      easy-going soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the end of his lane, he paused at his gate, and looked at
      his house, set back from the lane in a crescent of birches. Even in the
      moonlight, its weather-worn aspect was plainly visible. He thought of the
      &ldquo;palatial residence&rdquo; rumour ascribed to Arnold Sherman in Boston, and
      stroked his chin nervously with his sunburnt fingers. Then he doubled up
      his fist and struck it smartly on the gate-post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodora needn&rsquo;t think she is going to jilt me in this fashion, after
      keeping company with me for fifteen years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;LL have something
      to say to it, Arnold Sherman or no Arnold Sherman. The impudence of the
      puppy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Ludovic drove to Carmody and engaged Joshua Pye to come
      and paint his house, and that evening, although he was not due till
      Saturday night, he went down to see Theodora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold Sherman was there before him, and was actually sitting in Ludovic&rsquo;s
      own prescriptive chair. Ludovic had to deposit himself in Theodora&rsquo;s new
      wicker rocker, where he looked and felt lamentably out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Theodora felt the situation to be awkward, she carried it off superbly.
      She had never looked handsomer, and Ludovic perceived that she wore her
      second best silk dress. He wondered miserably if she had donned it in
      expectation of his rival&rsquo;s call. She had never put on silk dresses for
      him. Ludovic had always been the meekest and mildest of mortals, but he
      felt quite murderous as he sat mutely there and listened to Arnold
      Sherman&rsquo;s polished conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should just have been here to see him glowering,&rdquo; Theodora told the
      delighted Anne the next day. &ldquo;It may be wicked of me, but I felt real
      glad. I was afraid he might stay away and sulk. So long as he comes here
      and sulks I don&rsquo;t worry. But he is feeling badly enough, poor soul, and
      I&rsquo;m really eaten up by remorse. He tried to outstay Mr. Sherman last
      night, but he didn&rsquo;t manage it. You never saw a more depressed-looking
      creature than he was as he hurried down the lane. Yes, he actually
      hurried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following Sunday evening Arnold Sherman walked to church with
      Theodora, and sat with her. When they came in Ludovic Speed suddenly stood
      up in his pew under the gallery. He sat down again at once, but everybody
      in view had seen him, and that night folks in all the length and breadth
      of Grafton River discussed the dramatic occurrence with keen enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he jumped right up as if he was pulled on his feet, while the
      minister was reading the chapter,&rdquo; said his cousin, Lorella Speed, who had
      been in church, to her sister, who had not. &ldquo;His face was as white as a
      sheet, and his eyes were just glaring out of his head. I never felt so
      thrilled, I declare! I almost expected him to fly at them then and there.
      But he just gave a sort of gasp and set down again. I don&rsquo;t know whether
      Theodora Dix saw him or not. She looked as cool and unconcerned as you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodora had not seen Ludovic, but if she looked cool and unconcerned, her
      appearance belied her, for she felt miserably flustered. She could not
      prevent Arnold Sherman coming to church with her, but it seemed to her
      like going too far. People did not go to church and sit together in
      Grafton unless they were the next thing to being engaged. What if this
      filled Ludovic with the narcotic of despair instead of wakening him up!
      She sat through the service in misery and heard not one word of the
      sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ludovic&rsquo;s spectacular performances were not yet over. The Speeds might
      be hard to get started, but once they were started their momentum was
      irresistible. When Theodora and Mr. Sherman came out, Ludovic was waiting
      on the steps. He stood up straight and stern, with his head thrown back
      and his shoulders squared. There was open defiance in the look he cast on
      his rival, and masterfulness in the mere touch of the hand he laid on
      Theodora&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I see you home, Miss Dix?&rdquo; his words said. His tone said, &ldquo;I am going
      to see you home whether or no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodora, with a deprecating look at Arnold Sherman, took his arm, and
      Ludovic marched her across the green amid a silence which the very horses
      tied to the storm fence seemed to share. For Ludovic &lsquo;twas a crowded hour
      of glorious life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne walked all the way over from Avonlea the next day to hear the news.
      Theodora smiled consciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is really settled at last, Anne. Coming home last night Ludovic
      asked me plump and plain to marry him,&mdash;Sunday and all as it was.
      It&rsquo;s to be right away&mdash;for Ludovic won&rsquo;t be put off a week longer
      than necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Ludovic Speed has been hurried up to some purpose at last,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Sherman, when Anne called in at Echo Lodge, brimful with her news. &ldquo;And
      you are delighted, of course, and my poor pride must be the scapegoat. I
      shall always be remembered in Grafton as the man from Boston who wanted
      Theodora Dix and couldn&rsquo;t get her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that won&rsquo;t be true, you know,&rdquo; said Anne comfortingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold Sherman thought of Theodora&rsquo;s ripe beauty, and the mellow
      companionableness she had revealed in their brief intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not perfectly sure of that,&rdquo; he said, with a half sigh.

    <h2>
      II. Old Lady Lloyd
    </h2>
    <p>
      I. The May Chapter
    </p>
    <p>
      Spencervale gossip always said that &ldquo;Old Lady Lloyd&rdquo; was rich and mean and
      proud. Gossip, as usual, was one-third right and two-thirds wrong. Old
      Lady Lloyd was neither rich nor mean; in reality she was pitifully poor&mdash;so
      poor that &ldquo;Crooked Jack&rdquo; Spencer, who dug her garden and chopped her wood
      for her, was opulent by contrast, for he, at least, never lacked three
      meals a day, and the Old Lady could sometimes achieve no more than one.
      But she WAS very proud&mdash;so proud that she would have died rather than
      let the Spencervale people, among whom she had queened it in her youth,
      suspect how poor she was and to what straits was sometimes reduced. She
      much preferred to have them think her miserly and odd&mdash;a queer old
      recluse who never went anywhere, even to church, and who paid the smallest
      subscription to the minister&rsquo;s salary of anyone in the congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her just rolling in wealth!&rdquo; they said indignantly. &ldquo;Well, she didn&rsquo;t
      get her miserly ways from her parents. THEY were real generous and
      neighbourly. There never was a finer gentleman than old Doctor Lloyd. He
      was always doing kindnesses to everybody; and he had a way of doing them
      that made you feel as if you was doing the favour, not him. Well, well,
      let Old Lady Lloyd keep herself and her money to herself if she wants to.
      If she doesn&rsquo;t want our company, she doesn&rsquo;t have to suffer it, that&rsquo;s
      all. Reckon she isn&rsquo;t none too happy for all her money and pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, the Old Lady was none too happy, that was unfortunately true. It is
      not easy to be happy when your life is eaten up with loneliness and
      emptiness on the spiritual side, and when, on the material side, all you
      have between you and starvation is the little money your hens bring you
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady lived &ldquo;away back at the old Lloyd place,&rdquo; as it was always
      called. It was a quaint, low-eaved house, with big chimneys and square
      windows and with spruces growing thickly all around it. The Old Lady lived
      there all alone and there were weeks at a time when she never saw a human
      being except Crooked Jack. What the Old Lady did with herself and how she
      put in her time was a puzzle the Spencervale people could not solve. The
      children believed she amused herself counting the gold in the big black
      box under her bed. Spencervale children held the Old Lady in mortal
      terror; some of them&mdash;the &ldquo;Spencer Road&rdquo; fry&mdash;believed she was a
      witch; all of them would run if, when wandering about the woods in search
      of berries or spruce gum, they saw at a distance the spare, upright form
      of the Old Lady, gathering sticks for her fire. Mary Moore was the only
      one who was quite sure she was not a witch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Witches are always ugly,&rdquo; she said decisively, &ldquo;and Old Lady Lloyd isn&rsquo;t
      ugly. She&rsquo;s real pretty&mdash;she&rsquo;s got such a soft white hair and big
      black eyes and a little white face. Those Road children don&rsquo;t know what
      they&rsquo;re talking of. Mother says they&rsquo;re a very ignorant crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she doesn&rsquo;t ever go to church, and she mutters and talks to herself
      all the time she&rsquo;s picking up sticks,&rdquo; maintained Jimmy Kimball stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady talked to herself because she was really very fond of company
      and conversation. To be sure, when you have talked to nobody but yourself
      for nearly twenty years, it is apt to grow somewhat monotonous; and there
      were times when the Old Lady would have sacrificed everything but her
      pride for a little human companionship. At such times she felt very bitter
      and resentful toward Fate for having taken everything from her. She had
      nothing to love, and that is about as unwholesome a condition as is
      possible to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was always hardest in the spring. Once upon a time the Old Lady&mdash;when
      she had not been the Old Lady, but pretty, wilful, high-spirited Margaret
      Lloyd&mdash;had loved springs; now she hated them because they hurt her;
      and this particular spring of this particular May chapter hurt her more
      than any that had gone before. The Old Lady felt as if she could NOT
      endure the ache of it. Everything hurt her&mdash;the new green tips on the
      firs, the fairy mists down in the little beech hollow below the house, the
      fresh smell of the red earth Crooked Jack spaded up in her garden. The Old
      Lady lay awake all one moonlit night and cried for very heartache. She
      even forgot her body hunger in her soul hunger; and the Old Lady had been
      hungry, more or less, all that week. She was living on store biscuits and
      water, so that she might be able to pay Crooked Jack for digging her
      garden. When the pale, lovely dawn-colour came stealing up the sky behind
      the spruces, the Old Lady buried her face in her pillow and refused to
      look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate the new day,&rdquo; she said rebelliously. &ldquo;It will be just like all the
      other hard, common days. I don&rsquo;t want to get up and live it. And, oh, to
      think that long ago I reached out my hands joyfully to every new day, as
      to a friend who was bringing me good tidings! I loved the mornings then&mdash;sunny
      or gray, they were as delightful as an unread book&mdash;and now I hate
      them&mdash;hate them&mdash;hate them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Old Lady got up nevertheless, for she knew Crooked Jack would be
      coming early to finish the garden. She arranged her beautiful, thick,
      white hair very carefully, and put on her purple silk dress with the
      little gold spots in it. The Old Lady always wore silk from motives of
      economy. It was much cheaper to wear a silk dress that had belonged to her
      mother than to buy new print at the store. The Old Lady had plenty of silk
      dresses which had belonged to her mother. She wore them morning, noon, and
      night, and Spencervale people considered it an additional evidence of her
      pride. As for the fashion of them, it was, of course, just because she was
      too mean to have them made over. They did not dream that the Old Lady
      never put on one of the silk dresses without agonizing over its
      unfashionableness, and that even the eyes of Crooked Jack cast on her
      antique flounces and overskirts was almost more than her feminine vanity
      could endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the fact that the Old Lady had not welcomed the new day, its
      beauty charmed her when she went out for a walk after her dinner&mdash;or,
      rather, after her mid-day biscuit. It was so fresh, so sweet, so virgin;
      and the spruce woods around the old Lloyd place were athrill with busy
      spring doings and all sprinkled through with young lights and shadows.
      Some of their delight found its way into the Old Lady&rsquo;s bitter heart as
      she wandered through them, and when she came out at the little plank
      bridge over the brook down under the beeches, she felt almost gentle and
      tender once more. There was one big beech there, in particular, which the
      Old Lady loved for reasons best known to herself&mdash;a great, tall beech
      with a trunk like the shaft of a gray marble column and a leafy spread of
      branches over the still, golden-brown pool made beneath it by the brook.
      It had been a young sapling in the days that were haloed by the vanished
      glory of the Old Lady&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady heard childish voices and laughter afar up the lane which led
      to William Spencer&rsquo;s place just above the woods. William Spencer&rsquo;s front
      lane ran out to the main road in a different direction, but this &ldquo;back
      lane&rdquo; furnished a short cut and his children always went to school that
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady shrank hastily back behind a clump of young spruces. She did
      not like the Spencer children because they always seemed so afraid of her.
      Through the spruce screen she could see them coming gaily down the lane&mdash;the
      two older ones in front, the twins behind, clinging to the hands of a
      tall, slim, young girl&mdash;the new music teacher, probably. The Old Lady
      had heard from the egg pedlar that she was going to board at William
      Spencer&rsquo;s, but she had not heard her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at her with some curiosity as they drew near&mdash;and then,
      all at once, the Old Lady&rsquo;s heart gave a great bound and began to beat as
      it had not beaten for years, while her breath came quickly and she
      trembled violently. Who&mdash;WHO could this girl be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the new music teacher&rsquo;s straw hat were masses of fine chestnut hair
      of the very shade and wave that the Old Lady remembered on another head in
      vanished years; from under those waves looked large, violet-blue eyes with
      very black lashes and brows&mdash;and the Old Lady knew those eyes as well
      as she knew her own; and the new music teacher&rsquo;s face, with all its beauty
      of delicate outline and dainty colouring and glad, buoyant youth, was a
      face from the Old Lady&rsquo;s past&mdash;a perfect resemblance in every respect
      save one; the face which the Old Lady remembered had been weak, with all
      its charm; but this girl&rsquo;s face possessed a fine, dominant strength
      compact of sweetness and womanliness. As she passed by the Old Lady&rsquo;s
      hiding place she laughed at something one of the children said; and oh,
      but the Old Lady knew that laughter well. She had heard it before under
      that very beech tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched them until they disappeared over the wooded hill beyond the
      bridge; and then she went back home as if she walked in a dream. Crooked
      Jack was delving vigorously in the garden; ordinarily the Old Lady did not
      talk much with Crooked Jack, for she disliked his weakness for gossip; but
      now she went into the garden, a stately old figure in her purple,
      gold-spotted silk, with the sunshine gleaming on her white hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crooked Jack had seen her go out and had remarked to himself that the Old
      Lady was losing ground; she was pale and peaked-looking. He now concluded
      that he had been mistaken. The Old Lady&rsquo;s cheeks were pink and her eyes
      shining. Somewhere in her walk she had shed ten years at least. Crooked
      Jack leaned on his spade and decided that there weren&rsquo;t many finer looking
      women anywhere than Old Lady Lloyd. Pity she was such an old miser!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Spencer,&rdquo; said the Old Lady graciously&mdash;she always spoke very
      graciously to her inferiors when she talked to them at all&mdash;&ldquo;can you
      tell me the name of the new music teacher who is boarding at Mr. William
      Spencer&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia Gray,&rdquo; said Crooked Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady&rsquo;s heart gave another great bound. But she had known it&mdash;she
      had known that girl with Leslie Gray&rsquo;s hair and eyes and laugh must be
      Leslie Gray&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crooked Jack spat on his hand and resumed his work, but his tongue went
      faster than his spade, and the Old Lady listened greedily. For the first
      time she enjoyed and blessed Crooked Jack&rsquo;s garrulity and gossip. Every
      word he uttered was as an apple of gold in a picture of silver to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been working at William Spencer&rsquo;s the day the new music teacher had
      come, and what Crooked Jack couldn&rsquo;t find out about any person in one
      whole day&mdash;at least as far as outward life went&mdash;was hardly
      worth finding out. Next to discovering things did he love telling them,
      and it would be hard to say which enjoyed that ensuing half-hour more&mdash;Crooked
      Jack or the Old Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crooked Jack&rsquo;s account, boiled down, amounted to this; both Miss Gray&rsquo;s
      parents had died when she was a baby, she had been brought up by an aunt,
      she was very poor and very ambitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wants a moosical eddication,&rdquo; finished up Crooked Jack, &ldquo;and, by jingo,
      she orter have it, for anything like the voice of her I never heerd. She
      sung for us that evening after supper and I thought &lsquo;twas an angel
      singing. It just went through me like a shaft o&rsquo; light. The Spencer young
      ones are crazy over her already. She&rsquo;s got twenty pupils around here and
      in Grafton and Avonlea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Old Lady had found out everything Crooked Jack could tell her,
      she went into the house and sat down by the window of her little
      sitting-room to think it all over. She was tingling from head to foot with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie&rsquo;s daughter! This Old Lady had had her romance once. Long ago&mdash;forty
      years ago&mdash;she had been engaged to Leslie Gray, a young college
      student who taught in Spencervale for the summer term one year&mdash;the
      golden summer of Margaret Lloyd&rsquo;s life. Leslie had been a shy, dreamy,
      handsome fellow with literary ambitions, which, as he and Margaret both
      firmly believed, would one day bring him fame and fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there had been a foolish, bitter quarrel at the end of that golden
      summer. Leslie had gone away in anger, afterwards he had written, but
      Margaret Lloyd, still in the grasp of her pride and resentment, had sent a
      harsh answer. No more letters came; Leslie Gray never returned; and one
      day Margaret wakened to the realization that she had put love out of her
      life for ever. She knew it would never be hers again; and from that moment
      her feet were turned from youth to walk down the valley of shadow to a
      lonely, eccentric age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years later she heard of Leslie&rsquo;s marriage; then came news of his
      death, after a life that had not fulfilled his dreams for him. Nothing
      more she had heard or known&mdash;nothing to this day, when she had seen
      his daughter pass her by unseeing in the beech hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His daughter! And she might have been MY daughter,&rdquo; murmured the Old
      Lady. &ldquo;Oh, if I could only know her and love her&mdash;and perhaps win her
      love in return! But I cannot. I could not have Leslie Gray&rsquo;s daughter know
      how poor I am&mdash;how low I have been brought. I could not bear that.
      And to think she is living so near me, the darling&mdash;just up the lane
      and over the hill. I can see her go by every day&mdash;I can have that
      dear pleasure, at least. But oh, if I could only do something for her&mdash;give
      her some little pleasure! It would be such a delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Old Lady happened to go into her spare room that evening, she saw
      from it a light shining through a gap in the trees on the hill. She knew
      that it shone from the Spencers&rsquo; spare room. So it was Sylvia&rsquo;s light. The
      Old Lady stood in the darkness and watched it until it went out&mdash;watched
      it with a great sweetness breathing in her heart, such as risen from old
      rose-leaves when they are stirred. She fancied Sylvia moving about her
      room, brushing and braiding her long, glistening hair&mdash;laying aside
      her little trinkets and girlish adornments&mdash;making her simple
      preparations for sleep. When the light went out the Old Lady pictured a
      slight white figure kneeling by the window in the soft starshine, and the
      Old Lady knelt down then and there and said her own prayers in fellowship.
      She said the simple form of words she had always used; but a new spirit
      seemed to inspire them; and she finished with a new petition&mdash;&ldquo;Let me
      think of something I can do for her, dear Father&mdash;some little, little
      thing that I can do for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady had slept in the same room all her life&mdash;the one looking
      north into the spruces&mdash;and loved it; but the next day she moved into
      the spare room without a regret. It was to be her room after this; she
      must be where she could see Sylvia&rsquo;s light, she put the bed where she
      could lie in it and look at that earth star which had suddenly shone
      across the twilight shadows of her heart. She felt very happy, she had not
      felt happy for many years; but now a strange, new, dream-like interest,
      remote from the harsh realities of her existence, but none the less
      comforting and alluring, had entered into her life. Besides, she had
      thought of something she could do for Sylvia&mdash;&ldquo;a little, little
      thing&rdquo; that might give her pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spencervale people were wont to say regretfully that there were no
      Mayflowers in Spencervale; the Spencervale young fry, when they wanted
      Mayflowers, thought they had to go over to the barrens at Avonlea, six
      miles away, for them. Old Lady Lloyd knew better. In her many long,
      solitary rambles, she had discovered a little clearing far back in the
      woods&mdash;a southward-sloping, sandy hill on a tract of woodland
      belonging to a man who lived in town&mdash;which in spring was starred
      over with the pink and white of arbutus.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this clearing the Old Lady betook herself that afternoon, walking
      through wood lanes and under dim spruce arches like a woman with a glad
      purpose. All at once the spring was dear and beautiful to her once more;
      for love had entered again into her heart, and her starved soul was
      feasting on its divine nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Lady Lloyd found a wealth of Mayflowers on the sandy hill. She filled
      her basket with them, gloating over the loveliness which was to give
      pleasure to Sylvia. When she got home she wrote on a slip of paper, &ldquo;For
      Sylvia.&rdquo; It was not likely anyone in Spencervale would know her
      handwriting, but, to make sure, she disguised it, writing in round, big
      letters like a child&rsquo;s. She carried her Mayflowers down to the hollow and
      heaped them in a recess between the big roots of the old beech, with the
      little note thrust through a stem on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Old Lady deliberately hid behind the spruce clump. She had put on
      her dark green silk on purpose for hiding. She had not long to wait. Soon
      Sylvia Gray came down the hill with Mattie Spencer. When she reached the
      bridge she saw the Mayflowers and gave an exclamation of delight. Then she
      saw her name and her expression changed to wonder. The Old Lady, peering
      through the boughs, could have laughed for very pleasure over the success
      of her little plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me!&rdquo; said Sylvia, lifting the flowers. &ldquo;CAN they really be for me,
      Mattie? Who could have left them here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mattie giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it was Chris Stewart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know he was over at Avonlea
      last night. And ma says he&rsquo;s taken a notion to you&mdash;she knows by the
      way he looked at you when you were singing night before last. It would be
      just like him to do something queer like this&mdash;he&rsquo;s such a shy fellow
      with the girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia frowned a little. She did not like Mattie&rsquo;s expressions, but she
      did like Mayflowers, and she did not dislike Chris Stewart, who had seemed
      to her merely a nice, modest, country boy. She lifted the flowers and
      buried her face in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m much obliged to the giver, whoever he or she is,&rdquo; she said
      merrily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I love like Mayflowers. Oh, how sweet they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had passed the Old Lady emerged from her lurking place, flushed
      with triumph. It did not vex her that Sylvia should think Chris Stewart
      had given her the flowers; nay, it was all the better, since she would be
      the less likely to suspect the real donor. The main thing was that Sylvia
      should have the delight of them. That quite satisfied the Old Lady, who
      went back to her lonely house with the cockles of her heart all in a glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon was a matter of gossip in Spencervale that Chris Stewart was
      leaving Mayflowers at the beech hollow for the music teacher every other
      day. Chris himself denied it, but he was not believed. Firstly, there were
      no Mayflowers in Spencervale; secondly, Chris had to go to Carmody every
      other day to haul milk to the butter factory, and Mayflowers grew in
      Carmody, and, thirdly, the Stewarts always had a romantic streak in them.
      Was not that enough circumstantial evidence for anybody?
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Sylvia, she did not mind if Chris had a boyish admiration for her
      and expressed it thus delicately. She thought it very nice of him, indeed,
      when he did not vex her with any other advances, and she was quite content
      to enjoy his Mayflowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Lady Lloyd heard all the gossip about it from the egg pedlar, and
      listened to him with laughter glimmering far down in her eyes. The egg
      pedlar went away and vowed he&rsquo;d never seen the Old Lady so spry as she was
      this spring; she seemed real interested in the young folk&rsquo;s doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady kept her secret and grew young in it. She walked back to the
      Mayflower hill as long as the Mayflowers lasted; and she always hid in the
      spruces to see Sylvia Gray go by. Every day she loved her more, and
      yearned after her more deeply. All the long repressed tenderness of her
      nature overflowed to this girl who was unconscious of it. She was proud of
      Sylvia&rsquo;s grace and beauty, and sweetness of voice and laughter. She began
      to like the Spencer children because they worshipped Sylvia; she envied
      Mrs. Spencer because the latter could minister to Sylvia&rsquo;s needs. Even the
      egg pedlar seemed a delightful person because he brought news of Sylvia&mdash;her
      social popularity, her professional success, the love and admiration she
      had won already.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady never dreamed of revealing herself to Sylvia. That, in her
      poverty, was not to be thought of for a moment. It would have been very
      sweet to know her&mdash;sweet to have her come to the old house&mdash;sweet
      to talk to her&mdash;to enter into her life. But it might not be. The Old
      Lady&rsquo;s pride was still far stronger than her love. It was the one thing
      she had never sacrificed and never&mdash;so she believed&mdash;could
      sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. The June Chapter
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no Mayflowers in June; but now the Old Lady&rsquo;s garden was full
      of blossoms and every morning Sylvia found a bouquet of them by the beech&mdash;the
      perfumed ivory of white narcissus, the flame of tulips, the fairy branches
      of bleeding-heart, the pink-and-snow of little, thorny, single,
      sweetbreathed early roses. The Old Lady had no fear of discovery, for the
      flowers that grew in her garden grew in every other Spencervale garden as
      well, including the Stewart garden. Chris Stewart, when he was teased
      about the music teacher, merely smiled and held his peace. Chris knew
      perfectly well who was the real giver of those flowers. He had made it his
      business to find out when the Mayflower gossip started. But since it was
      evident Old Lady Lloyd did not wish it to be known, Chris told no one.
      Chris had always liked Old Lady Lloyd ever since the day, ten years
      before, when she had found him crying in the woods with a cut foot and had
      taken him into her house, and bathed and bound the wound, and given him
      ten cents to buy candy at the store. The Old Lady went without supper that
      night because of it, but Chris never knew that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady thought it a most beautiful June. She no longer hated the new
      days; on the contrary, she welcomed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day is an uncommon day now,&rdquo; she said jubilantly to herself&mdash;for
      did not almost every day bring her a glimpse of Sylvia? Even on rainy days
      the Old Lady gallantly braved rheumatism to hide behind her clump of
      dripping spruces and watch Sylvia pass. The only days she could not see
      her were Sundays; and no Sundays had ever seemed so long to Old Lady Lloyd
      as those June Sundays did.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the egg pedlar had news for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The music teacher is going to sing a solo for a collection piece
      to-morrow,&rdquo; he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady&rsquo;s black eyes flashed with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Miss Gray was a member of the choir,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jined two Sundays ago. I tell you, our music is something worth listening
      to now. The church&rsquo;ll be packed to-morrow, I reckon&mdash;her name&rsquo;s gone
      all over the country for singing. You ought to come and hear it, Miss
      Lloyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pedlar said this out of bravado, merely to show he wasn&rsquo;t scared of
      the Old Lady, for all her grand airs. The Old Lady made no answer, and he
      thought he had offended her. He went away, wishing he hadn&rsquo;t said it. Had
      he but known it, the Old Lady had forgotten the existence of all and any
      egg pedlars. He had blotted himself and his insignificance out of her
      consciousness by his last sentence. All her thoughts, feelings, and wishes
      were submerged in a very whirlpool of desire to hear Sylvia sing that
      solo. She went into the house in a tumult and tried to conquer that
      desire. She could not do it, even thought she summoned all her pride to
      her aid. Pride said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to go to church to hear her. You haven&rsquo;t fit clothes to go
      to church in. Think what a figure you will make before them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, for the first time, a more insistent voice than pride spoke to her
      soul&mdash;and, for the first time, the Old Lady listened to it. It was
      too true that she had never gone to church since the day on which she had
      to begin wearing her mother&rsquo;s silk dresses. The Old Lady herself thought
      that this was very wicked; and she tried to atone by keeping Sunday very
      strictly, and always having a little service of her own, morning and
      evening. She sang three hymns in her cracked voice, prayed aloud, and read
      a sermon. But she could not bring herself to go to church in her
      out-of-date clothes&mdash;she, who had once set the fashions in
      Spencervale, and the longer she stayed away, the more impossible it seemed
      that she should ever again go. Now the impossible had become, not only
      possible, but insistent. She must go to church and hear Sylvia sing, no
      matter how ridiculous she appeared, no matter how people talked and
      laughed at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spencervale congregation had a mild sensation the next afternoon. Just
      before the opening of service Old Lady Lloyd walked up the aisle and sat
      down in the long-unoccupied Lloyd pew, in front of the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady&rsquo;s very soul was writhing within her. She recalled the
      reflection she had seen in her mirror before she left&mdash;the old black
      silk in the mode of thirty years agone and the queer little bonnet of
      shirred black satin. She thought how absurd she must look in the eyes of
      her world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, she did not look in the least absurd. Some women
      might have; but the Old Lady&rsquo;s stately distinction of carriage and figure
      was so subtly commanding that it did away with the consideration of
      garmenting altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady did not know this. But she did know that Mrs. Kimball, the
      storekeeper&rsquo;s wife, presently rustled into the next pew in the very latest
      fashion of fabric and mode; she and Mrs. Kimball were the same age, and
      there had been a time when the latter had been content to imitate Margaret
      Lloyd&rsquo;s costumes at a humble distance. But the storekeeper had proposed,
      and things were changed now; and there sat poor Old Lady Lloyd, feeling
      the change bitterly, and half wishing she had not come to church at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all at once the Angel of Love touched these foolish thoughts, born of
      vanity and morbid pride, and they melted away as if they had never been.
      Sylvia Gray had come into the choir, and was sitting just where the
      afternoon sunshine fell over her beautiful hair like a halo. The Old Lady
      looked at her in a rapture of satisfied longing and thenceforth the
      service was blessed to her, as anything is blessed which comes through the
      medium of unselfish love, whether human or divine. Nay, are they not one
      and the same, differing in degree only, not in kind?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady had never had such a good, satisfying look at Sylvia before.
      All her former glimpses had been stolen and fleeting. Now she sat and
      gazed upon her to her hungry heart&rsquo;s content, lingering delightedly over
      every little charm and loveliness&mdash;the way Sylvia&rsquo;s shining hair
      rippled back from her forehead, the sweet little trick she had of dropping
      quickly her long-lashed eyelids when she encountered too bold or curious a
      glance, and the slender, beautifully modelled hands&mdash;so like Leslie
      Gray&rsquo;s hands&mdash;that held her hymn book. She was dressed very plainly
      in a black skirt and a white shirtwaist; but none of the other girls in
      the choir, with all their fine feathers, could hold a candle to her&mdash;as
      the egg pedlar said to his wife, going home from church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady listened to the opening hymns with keen pleasure. Sylvia&rsquo;s
      voice thrilled through and dominated them all. But when the ushers got up
      to take the collection, an undercurrent of subdued excitement flowed over
      the congregation. Sylvia rose and came forward to Janet Moore&rsquo;s side at
      the organ. The next moment her beautiful voice soared through the building
      like the very soul of melody&mdash;true, clear, powerful, sweet. Nobody in
      Spencervale had ever listened to such a voice, except Old Lady Lloyd
      herself, who, in her youth, had heard enough good singing to enable her to
      be a tolerable judge of it. She realized instantly that this girl of her
      heart had a great gift&mdash;a gift that would some day bring her fame and
      fortune, if it could be duly trained and developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad I came to church,&rdquo; thought Old Lady Lloyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the solo was ended, the Old Lady&rsquo;s conscience compelled her to drag
      her eyes and thoughts from Sylvia, and fasten them on the minister, who
      had been flattering himself all through the opening portion of the service
      that Old Lady Lloyd had come to church on his account. He was newly
      settled, having been in charge of the Spencervale congregation only a few
      months; he was a clever little fellow and he honestly thought it was the
      fame of his preaching that had brought Old Lady Lloyd out to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the service was over all the Old Lady&rsquo;s neighbours came to speak to
      her, with kindly smile and handshake. They thought they ought to encourage
      her, now that she had made a start in the right direction; the Old Lady
      liked their cordiality, and liked it none the less because she detected in
      it the same unconscious respect and deference she had been wont to receive
      in the old days&mdash;a respect and deference which her personality
      compelled from all who approached her. The Old Lady was surprised to find
      that she could command it still, in defiance of unfashionable bonnet and
      ancient attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet Moore and Sylvia Gray walked home from church together. &ldquo;Did you see
      Old Lady Lloyd out to-day?&rdquo; asked Janet. &ldquo;I was amazed when she walked in.
      She has never been to church in my recollection. What a quaint old figure
      she is! She&rsquo;s very rich, you know, but she wears her mother&rsquo;s old clothes
      and never gets a new thing. Some people think she is mean; but,&rdquo; concluded
      Janet charitably, &ldquo;I believe it is simply eccentricity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt that was Miss Lloyd as soon as I saw her, although I had never
      seen her before,&rdquo; said Sylvia dreamily. &ldquo;I have been wishing to see her&mdash;for
      a certain reason. She has a very striking face. I should like to meet her&mdash;to
      know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely you ever will,&rdquo; said Janet carelessly. &ldquo;She
      doesn&rsquo;t like young people and she never goes anywhere. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d
      like to know her. I&rsquo;d be afraid of her&mdash;she has such stately ways and
      such strange, piercing eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of her,&rdquo; said Sylvia to herself, as she
      turned into the Spencer lane. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t expect I&rsquo;ll ever become
      acquainted with her. If she knew who I am I suppose she would dislike me.
      I suppose she never suspects that I am Leslie Gray&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister, thinking it well to strike while the iron was hot, went up
      to call on Old Lady Lloyd the very next afternoon. He went in fear and
      trembling, for he had heard things about Old Lady Lloyd; but she made
      herself so agreeable in her high-bred fashion that he was delighted, and
      told his wife when he went home that Spencervale people didn&rsquo;t understand
      Miss Lloyd. This was perfectly true; but it is by no means certain that
      the minister understood her either.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made only one mistake in tact, but, as the Old Lady did not snub him
      for it, he never knew he made it. When he was leaving he said, &ldquo;I hope we
      shall see you at church next Sunday, Miss Lloyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, you will,&rdquo; said the Old Lady emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      III. The July Chapter
    </p>
    <p>
      The first day of July Sylvia found a little birch bark boat full of
      strawberries at the beech in the hollow. They were the earliest of the
      season; the Old Lady had found them in one of her secret haunts. They
      would have been a toothsome addition to the Old Lady&rsquo;s own slender bill of
      fare; but she never thought of eating them. She got far more pleasure out
      of the thought of Sylvia&rsquo;s enjoying them for her tea. Thereafter the
      strawberries alternated with the flowers as long as they lasted, and then
      came blueberries and raspberries. The blueberries grew far away and the
      Old Lady had many a tramp after them. Sometimes her bones ached at night
      because of it; but what cared the Old Lady for that? Bone ache is easier
      to endure than soul ache; and the Old Lady&rsquo;s soul had stopped aching for
      the first time in many year. It was being nourished with heavenly manna.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening Crooked Jack came up to fix something that had gone wrong with
      the Old Lady&rsquo;s well. The Old Lady wandered affably out to him; for she
      knew he had been working at the Spencers&rsquo; all day, and there might be
      crumbs of information about Sylvia to be picked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon the music teacher&rsquo;s feeling pretty blue this evening,&rdquo; Crooked
      Jack remarked, after straining the Old Lady&rsquo;s patience to the last verge
      of human endurance by expatiating on William Spencer&rsquo;s new pump, and Mrs.
      Spencer&rsquo;s new washing-machine, and Amelia Spencer&rsquo;s new young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the Old Lady, turning very pale. Had anything happened to
      Sylvia?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s been invited to a big party at Mrs. Moore&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s in
      town, and she hasn&rsquo;t got a dress to go in,&rdquo; said Crooked Jack. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      great swells and everybody will be got up regardless. Mrs. Spencer was
      telling me about it. She says Miss Gray can&rsquo;t afford a new dress because
      she&rsquo;s helping to pay her aunt&rsquo;s doctor&rsquo;s bills. She says she&rsquo;s sure Miss
      Gray feels awful disappointed over it, though she doesn&rsquo;t let on. But Mrs.
      Spencer says she knows she was crying after she went to bed last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady turned and went into the house abruptly. This was dreadful.
      Sylvia must go to that party&mdash;she MUST. But how was it to be managed?
      Through the Old Lady&rsquo;s brain passed wild thoughts of her mother&rsquo;s silk
      dresses. But none of them would be suitable, even if there were time to
      make one over. Never had the Old Lady so bitterly regretted her vanished
      wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only two dollars in the house,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got to live on
      that till the next day the egg pedlar comes round. Is there anything I can
      sell&mdash;ANYTHING? Yes, yes, the grape jug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up to this time, the Old Lady would as soon have thought of trying to sell
      her head as the grape jug. The grape jug was two hundred years old and had
      been in the Lloyd family ever since it was a jug at all. It was a big,
      pot-bellied affair, festooned with pink-gilt grapes, and with a verse of
      poetry printed on one side, and it had been given as a wedding present to
      the Old Lady&rsquo;s great-grandmother. As long as the Old Lady could remember
      it had sat on the top shelf in the cupboard in the sitting-room wall, far
      too precious ever to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years before, a woman who collected old china had explored
      Spencervale, and, getting word of the grape jug, had boldly invaded the
      old Lloyd place and offered to buy it. She never, to her dying day, forgot
      the reception the Old Lady gave her; but, being wise in her day and
      generation, she left her card, saying that if Miss Lloyd ever changed her
      mind about selling the jug, she would find that she, the aforesaid
      collector, had not changed hers about buying it. People who make a hobby
      of heirloom china must meekly overlook snubs, and this particular person
      had never seen anything she coveted so much as that grape jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady had torn the card to pieces; but she remembered the name and
      address. She went to the cupboard and took down the beloved jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought to part with it,&rdquo; she said wistfully, &ldquo;but Sylvia must
      have a dress, and there is no other way. And, after all, when I&rsquo;m gone,
      who would there be to have it? Strangers would get it then&mdash;it might
      as well go to them now. I&rsquo;ll have to go to town to-morrow morning, for
      there&rsquo;s no time to lose if the party is Friday night. I haven&rsquo;t been to
      town for ten years. I dread the thought of going, more than parting with
      the jug. But for Sylvia&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was all over Spencervale by the next morning that Old Lady Lloyd had
      gone to town, carrying a carefully guarded box. Everybody wondered why she
      went; most people supposed she had become too frightened to keep her money
      in a black box below her bed, when there had been two burglaries over at
      Carmody, and had taken it to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady sought out the address of the china collector, trembling with
      fear that she might be dead or gone. But the collector was there, very
      much alive, and as keenly anxious to possess the grape jug as ever. The
      Old Lady, pallid with the pain of her trampled pride, sold the grape jug
      and went away, believing that her great-grandmother must have turned over
      in her grave at the moment of the transaction. Old Lady Lloyd felt like a
      traitor to her traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she went unflinchingly to a big store and, guided by that special
      Providence which looks after simple-minded old souls in their dangerous
      excursions into the world, found a sympathetic clerk who knew just what
      she wanted and got it for her. The Old Lady selected a very dainty muslin
      gown, with gloves and slippers in keeping; and she ordered it sent at
      once, expressage prepaid, to Miss Sylvia Gray, in care of William Spencer,
      Spencervale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she paid down the money&mdash;the whole price of the jug, minus a
      dollar and a half for railroad fare&mdash;with a grand, careless air and
      departed. As she marched erectly down the aisle of the store, she
      encountered a sleek, portly, prosperous man coming in. As their eyes met,
      the man started and his bland face flushed crimson; he lifted his hat and
      bowed confusedly. But the Old Lady looked through him as if he wasn&rsquo;t
      there, and passed on with not a sign of recognition about her. He took one
      step after her, then stopped and turned away, with a rather disagreeable
      smile and a shrug of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody would have guessed, as the Old Lady swept out, how her heart was
      seething with abhorrence and scorn. She would not have had the courage to
      come to town, even for Sylvia&rsquo;s sake, if she had thought she would meet
      Andrew Cameron. The mere sight of him opened up anew a sealed fountain of
      bitterness in her soul; but the thought of Sylvia somehow stemmed the
      torrent, and presently the Old Lady was smiling rather triumphantly,
      thinking rightly that she had come off best in that unwelcome encounter.
      SHE, at any rate, had not faltered and coloured, and lost her presence of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is little wonder HE did,&rdquo; thought the Old Lady vindictively. It
      pleased her that Andrew Cameron should lose, before her, the front of
      adamant he presented to the world. He was her cousin and the only living
      creature Old Lady Lloyd hated, and she hated and despised him with all the
      intensity of her intense nature. She and hers had sustained grievous wrong
      at his hands, and the Old Lady was convinced that she would rather die
      than take any notice of his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, she resolutely put Andrew Cameron out of her mind. It was
      desecration to think of him and Sylvia together. When she laid her weary
      head on her pillow that night she was so happy that even the thought of
      the vacant shelf in the room below, where the grape jug had always been,
      gave her only a momentary pang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sweet to sacrifice for one we love&mdash;it&rsquo;s sweet to have someone
      to sacrifice for,&rdquo; thought the Old Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desire grows by what it feeds on. The Old Lady thought she was content;
      but Friday evening came and found her in a perfect fever to see Sylvia in
      her party dress. It was not enough to fancy her in it; nothing would do
      the Old Lady but seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I SHALL see her,&rdquo; said the Old Lady resolutely, looking out from her
      window at Sylvia&rsquo;s light gleaming through the firs. She wrapped herself in
      a dark shawl and crept out, slipping down to the hollow and up the wood
      lane. It was a misty, moonlight night, and a wind, fragrant with the aroma
      of clover fields, blew down the lane to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could take your perfume&mdash;the soul of you&mdash;and pour it
      into her life,&rdquo; said the Old Lady aloud to that wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia Gray was standing in her room, ready for the party. Before her
      stood Mrs. Spencer and Amelia Spencer and all the little Spencer girls, in
      an admiring semi-circle. There was another spectator. Outside, under the
      lilac bush, Old Lady Lloyd was standing. She could see Sylvia plainly, in
      her dainty dress, with the pale pink roses Old Lady Lloyd had left at the
      beech that day for her in her hair. Pink as they were, they were not so
      pink as her cheeks, and her eyes shone like stars. Amelia Spencer put up
      her hand to push back a rose that had fallen a little out of place, and
      the Old Lady envied her fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That dress couldn&rsquo;t have fitted better if it had been made for you,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Spencer admiringly. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she lovely, Amelia? Who COULD have sent
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I feel sure that Mrs. Moore was the fairy godmother,&rdquo; said Sylvia.
      &ldquo;There is nobody else who would. It was dear of her&mdash;she knew I
      wished so much to go to the party with Janet. I wish Aunty could see me
      now.&rdquo; Sylvia gave a little sigh in spite of her joy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody else
      to care very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Sylvia, you were wrong! There was somebody else&mdash;somebody who
      cared very much&mdash;an Old Lady, with eager, devouring eyes, who was
      standing under the lilac bush and who presently stole away through the
      moonlit orchard to the woods like a shadow, going home with a vision of
      you in your girlish beauty to companion her through the watches of that
      summer night.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV. The August Chapter
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the minister&rsquo;s wife rushed in where Spencervale people had feared
      to tread, went boldly to Old Lady Lloyd, and asked her if she wouldn&rsquo;t
      come to their Sewing Circle, which met fortnightly on Saturday afternoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are filling a box to send to our Trinidad missionary,&rdquo; said the
      minister&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;and we should be so pleased to have you come, Miss
      Lloyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady was on the point of refusing rather haughtily. Not that she
      was opposed to missions&mdash;or sewing circles either&mdash;quite the
      contrary, but she knew that each member of the Circle was expected to pay
      ten cents a week for the purpose of procuring sewing materials; and the
      poor Old Lady really did not see how she could afford it. But a sudden
      thought checked her refusal before it reached her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose some of the young girls go to the Circle?&rdquo; she said craftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they all go,&rdquo; said the minister&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;Janet Moore and Miss Gray
      are our most enthusiastic members. It is very lovely of Miss Gray to give
      her Saturday afternoons&mdash;the only ones she has free from pupils&mdash;to
      our work. But she really has the sweetest disposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join your Circle,&rdquo; said the Old Lady promptly. She was determined
      she would do it, if she had to live on two meals a day to save the
      necessary fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the Sewing Circle at James Martin&rsquo;s the next Saturday, and did
      the most beautiful hand sewing for them. She was so expert at it that she
      didn&rsquo;t need to think about it at all, which was rather fortunate, for all
      her thoughts were taken up with Sylvia, who sat in the opposite corner
      with Janet Moore, her graceful hands busy with a little boy&rsquo;s coarse
      gingham shirt. Nobody thought of introducing Sylvia to Old Lady Lloyd, and
      the Old Lady was glad of it. She sewed finely away, and listened with all
      her ears to the girlish chatter which went on in the opposite corner. One
      thing she found out&mdash;Sylvia&rsquo;s birthday was the twentieth of August.
      And the Old Lady was straightway fired with a consuming wish to give
      Sylvia a birthday present. She lay awake most of the night wondering if
      she could do it, and most sorrowfully concluded that it was utterly out of
      the question, no matter how she might pinch and contrive. Old Lady Lloyd
      worried quite absurdly over this, and it haunted her like a spectre until
      the next Sewing Circle day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It met at Mrs. Moore&rsquo;s and Mrs. Moore was especially gracious to Old Lady
      Lloyd, and insisted on her taking the wicker rocker in the parlour. The
      Old Lady would rather have been in the sitting-room with the young girls,
      but she submitted for courtesy&rsquo;s sake&mdash;and she had her reward. Her
      chair was just behind the parlour door, and presently Janet Moore and
      Sylvia Gray came and sat on the stairs in the hall outside, where a cool
      breeze blew in through the maples before the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were talking of their favourite poets. Janet, it appeared, adored
      Byron and Scott. Sylvia leaned to Tennyson and Browning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Sylvia softly, &ldquo;my father was a poet? He published a
      little volume of verse once; and, Janet, I&rsquo;ve never seen a copy of it, and
      oh, how I would love to! It was published when he was at college&mdash;just
      a small, private edition to give his friends. He never published any more&mdash;poor
      father! I think life disappointed him. But I have such a longing to see
      that little book of his verse. I haven&rsquo;t a scrap of his writings. If I had
      it would seem as if I possessed something of him&mdash;of his heart, his
      soul, his inner life. He would be something more than a mere name to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he have a copy of his own&mdash;didn&rsquo;t your mother have one?&rdquo;
       asked Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother hadn&rsquo;t. She died when I was born, you know, but Aunty says there
      was no copy of father&rsquo;s poems among mother&rsquo;s books. Mother didn&rsquo;t care for
      poetry, Aunty says&mdash;Aunty doesn&rsquo;t either. Father went to Europe after
      mother died, and he died there the next year. Nothing that he had with him
      was ever sent home to us. He had sold most of his books before he went,
      but he gave a few of his favourite ones to Aunty to keep for me. HIS book
      wasn&rsquo;t among them. I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall ever find a copy, but I should
      be so delighted if I only could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Old Lady got home she took from her top bureau drawer an inlaid
      box of sandalwood. It held a little, slim, limp volume, wrapped in tissue
      paper&mdash;the Old Lady&rsquo;s most treasured possession. On the fly-leaf was
      written, &ldquo;To Margaret, with the author&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady turned the yellow leaves with trembling fingers and, through
      eyes brimming with tears, read the verses, although she had known them all
      by heart for years. She meant to give the book to Sylvia for a birthday
      present&mdash;one of the most precious gifts ever given, if the value of
      gifts is gauged by the measure of self-sacrifice involved. In that little
      book was immortal love&mdash;old laughter&mdash;old tears&mdash;old beauty
      which had bloomed like a rose years ago, holding still its sweetness like
      old rose leaves. She removed the telltale fly-leaf; and late on the night
      before Sylvia&rsquo;s birthday, the Old Lady crept, under cover of the darkness,
      through byways and across fields, as if bent on some nefarious expedition,
      to the little Spencervale store where the post-office was kept. She
      slipped the thin parcel through the slit in the door, and then stole home
      again, feeling a strange sense of loss and loneliness. It was as if she
      had given away the last link between herself and her youth. But she did
      not regret it. It would give Sylvia pleasure, and that had come to be the
      overmastering passion of the Old Lady&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night the light in Sylvia&rsquo;s room burned very late, and the Old
      Lady watched it triumphantly, knowing the meaning of it. Sylvia was
      reading her father&rsquo;s poems, and the Old Lady in her darkness read them
      too, murmuring the lines over and over to herself. After all, giving away
      the book had not mattered so very much. She had the soul of it still&mdash;and
      the fly-leaf with the name, in Leslie&rsquo;s writing, by which nobody ever
      called her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady was sitting on the Marshall sofa the next Sewing Circle
      afternoon when Sylvia Gray came and sat down beside her. The Old Lady&rsquo;s
      hands trembled a little, and one side of a handkerchief, which was
      afterwards given as a Christmas present to a little olive-skinned coolie
      in Trinidad, was not quite so exquisitely done as the other three sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia at first talked of the Circle, and Mrs. Marshall&rsquo;s dahlias, and the
      Old Lady was in the seventh heaven of delight, though she took care not to
      show it, and was even a little more stately and finely mannered than
      usual. When she asked Sylvia how she liked living in Spencervale, Sylvia
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much. Everybody is so kind to me. Besides&rdquo;&mdash;Sylvia lowered her
      voice so that nobody but the Old Lady could hear it&mdash;&ldquo;I have a fairy
      godmother here who does the most beautiful and wonderful things for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, being a girl of fine instincts, did not look at Old Lady Lloyd as
      she said this. But she would not have seen anything if she had looked. The
      Old Lady was not a Lloyd for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very interesting,&rdquo; she said, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it? I am so grateful to her and I have wished so much she might
      know how much pleasure she has given me. I have found lovely flowers and
      delicious berries on my path all summer; I feel sure she sent me my party
      dress. But the dearest gift came last week on my birthday&mdash;a little
      volume of my father&rsquo;s poems. I can&rsquo;t express what I felt on receiving
      them. But I longed to meet my fairy godmother and thank her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a fascinating mystery, isn&rsquo;t it? Have you really no idea who she
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady asked this dangerous question with marked success. She would
      not have been so successful if she had not been so sure that Sylvia had no
      idea of the old romance between her and Leslie Gray. As it was, she had a
      comfortable conviction that she herself was the very last person Sylvia
      would be likely to suspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia hesitated for an almost unnoticeable moment. Then she said, &ldquo;I
      haven&rsquo;t tried to find out, because I don&rsquo;t think she wants me to know. At
      first, of course, in the matter of the flowers and dress, I did try to
      solve the mystery; but, since I received the book, I became convinced that
      it was my fairy godmother who was doing it all, and I have respected her
      wish for concealment and always shall. Perhaps some day she will reveal
      herself to me. I hope so, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t hope it,&rdquo; said the Old Lady discouragingly. &ldquo;Fairy godmothers&mdash;at
      least, in all the fairy tales I ever read&mdash;are somewhat apt to be
      queer, crochety people, much more agreeable when wrapped up in mystery
      than when met face to face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced that mine is the very opposite, and that the better I
      became acquainted with her, the more charming a personage I should find
      her,&rdquo; said Sylvia gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Marshall came up at this juncture and entreated Miss Gray to sing for
      them. Miss Gray consenting sweetly, the Old Lady was left alone and was
      rather glad of it. She enjoyed her conversation with Sylvia much more in
      thinking it over after she got home than while it was taking place. When
      an Old Lady has a guilty conscience, it is apt to make her nervous and
      distract her thoughts from immediate pleasure. She wondered a little
      uneasily if Sylvia really did suspect her. Then she concluded that it was
      out of the question. Who would suspect a mean, unsociable Old Lady, who
      had no friends, and who gave only five cents to the Sewing Circle when
      everyone else gave ten or fifteen, to be a fairy godmother, the donor of
      beautiful party dresses, and the recipient of gifts from romantic,
      aspiring young poets?
    </p>
    <p>
      V. The September Chapter
    </p>
    <p>
      In September the Old Lady looked back on the summer and owned to herself
      that it had been a strangely happy one, with Sundays and Sewing Circle
      days standing out like golden punctuation marks in a poem of life. She
      felt like an utterly different woman; and other people thought her
      different also. The Sewing Circle women found her so pleasant, and even
      friendly, that they began to think they had misjudged her, and that
      perhaps it was eccentricity after all, and not meanness, which accounted
      for her peculiar mode of living. Sylvia Gray always came and talked to her
      on Circle afternoons now, and the Old Lady treasured every word she said
      in her heart and repeated them over and over to her lonely self in the
      watches of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia never talked of herself or her plans, unless asked about them; and
      the Old Lady&rsquo;s self-consciousness prevented her from asking any personal
      questions: so their conversation kept to the surface of things, and it was
      not from Sylvia, but from the minister&rsquo;s wife that the Old Lady finally
      discovered what her darling&rsquo;s dearest ambition was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister&rsquo;s wife had dropped in at the old Lloyd place one evening late
      in September, when a chilly wind was blowing up from the northeast and
      moaning about the eaves of the house, as if the burden of its lay were
      &ldquo;harvest is ended and summer is gone.&rdquo; The Old Lady had been listening to
      it, as she plaited a little basket of sweet grass for Sylvia. She had
      walked all the way to Avonlea sand-hills for it the day before, and she
      was very tired. And her heart was sad. This summer, which had so enriched
      her life, was almost over; and she knew that Sylvia Gray talked of leaving
      Spencervale at the end of October. The Old Lady&rsquo;s heart felt like very
      lead within her at the thought, and she almost welcomed the advent of the
      minister&rsquo;s wife as a distraction, although she was desperately afraid that
      the minister&rsquo;s wife had called to ask for a subscription for the new
      vestry carpet, and the Old Lady simply could not afford to give one cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the minister&rsquo;s wife had merely dropped in on her way home from the
      Spencers&rsquo; and she did not make any embarrassing requests. Instead, she
      talked about Sylvia Gray, and her words fell on the Old Lady&rsquo;s ears like
      separate pearl notes of unutterably sweet music. The minister&rsquo;s wife had
      nothing but praise for Sylvia&mdash;she was so sweet and beautiful and
      winning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with SUCH a voice,&rdquo; said the minister&rsquo;s wife enthusiastically, adding
      with a sigh, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a shame she can&rsquo;t have it properly trained. She
      would certainly become a great singer&mdash;competent critics have told
      her so. But she is so poor she doesn&rsquo;t think she can ever possibly manage
      it&mdash;unless she can get one of the Cameron scholarships, as they are
      called; and she has very little hope of that, although the professor of
      music who taught her has sent her name in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the Cameron scholarships?&rdquo; asked the Old Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose you have heard of Andrew Cameron, the millionaire?&rdquo; said
      the minister&rsquo;s wife, serenely unconscious that she was causing the very
      bones of the Old Lady&rsquo;s family skeleton to jangle in their closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the Old Lady&rsquo;s white face came a sudden faint stain of colour, as if
      a rough hand had struck her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard of him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it seems that he had a daughter, who was a very beautiful girl, and
      whom he idolized. She had a fine voice, and he was going to send her
      abroad to have it trained. And she died. It nearly broke his heart, I
      understand. But ever since, he sends one young girl away to Europe every
      year for a thorough musical education under the best teachers&mdash;in
      memory of his daughter. He has sent nine or ten already; but I fear there
      isn&rsquo;t much chance for Sylvia Gray, and she doesn&rsquo;t think there is
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the Old Lady spiritedly. &ldquo;I am sure that there can be few
      voices equal to Miss Gray&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true. But you see, these so-called scholarships are private affairs,
      dependent solely on the whim and choice of Andrew Cameron himself. Of
      course, when a girl has friends who use their influence with him, he will
      often send her on their recommendation. They say he sent a girl last year
      who hadn&rsquo;t much of a voice at all just because her father had been an old
      business crony of his. But Sylvia doesn&rsquo;t know anyone at all who would, to
      use a slang term, have any &lsquo;pull&rsquo; with Andrew Cameron, and she is not
      acquainted with him herself. Well, I must be going; we&rsquo;ll see you at the
      Manse on Saturday, I hope, Miss Lloyd. The Circle meets there, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said the Old Lady absently. When the minister&rsquo;s wife had
      gone, she dropped her sweetgrass basket and sat for a long, long time with
      her hands lying idly in her lap, and her big black eyes staring unseeingly
      at the wall before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Lady Lloyd, so pitifully poor that she had to eat six crackers the
      less a week to pay her fee to the Sewing Circle, knew that it was in her
      power&mdash;HERS&mdash;to send Leslie Gray&rsquo;s daughter to Europe for her
      musical education! If she chose to use her &ldquo;pull&rdquo; with Andrew Cameron&mdash;if
      she went to him and asked him to send Sylvia Gray abroad the next year&mdash;she
      had no doubt whatever that it would be done. It all lay with her&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;IF
      she could so far crush and conquer her pride as to stoop to ask a favour
      of the man who had wronged her and hers so bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years ago, her father, acting under the advice and urgency of Andrew
      Cameron, had invested all his little fortune in an enterprise that had
      turned out a failure. Abraham Lloyd lost every dollar he possessed, and
      his family were reduced to utter poverty. Andrew Cameron might have been
      forgiven for a mistake; but there was a strong suspicion, amounting to
      almost certainty, that he had been guilty of something far worse than a
      mistake in regard to his uncle&rsquo;s investment. Nothing could be legally
      proved; but it was certain that Andrew Cameron, already noted for his
      &ldquo;sharp practices,&rdquo; emerged with improved finances from an entanglement
      that had ruined many better men; and old Doctor Lloyd had died
      brokenhearted, believing that his nephew had deliberately victimized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Cameron had not quite done this; he had meant well enough by his
      uncle at first, and what he had finally done he tried to justify to
      himself by the doctrine that a man must look out for Number One.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Lloyd made no such excuses for him; she held him responsible, not
      only for her lost fortune, but for her father&rsquo;s death, and never forgave
      him for it. When Abraham Lloyd had died, Andrew Cameron, perhaps pricked
      by his conscience, had come to her, sleekly and smoothly, to offer her
      financial aid. He would see, he told her, that she never suffered want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Lloyd flung his offer back in his face after a fashion that left
      nothing to be desired in the way of plain speaking. She would die, she
      told him passionately, before she would accept a penny or a favour from
      him. He had preserved an unbroken show of good temper, expressed his
      heartfelt regret that she should cherish such an unjust opinion of him,
      and had left her with an oily assurance that he would always be her
      friend, and would always be delighted to render her any assistance in his
      power whenever she should choose to ask for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady had lived for twenty years in the firm conviction that she
      would die in the poorhouse&mdash;as, indeed, seemed not unlikely&mdash;before
      she would ask a favour of Andrew Cameron. And so, in truth, she would
      have, had it been for herself. But for Sylvia! Could she so far humble
      herself for Sylvia&rsquo;s sake?
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was not easily or speedily settled, as had been the case in
      the matters of the grape jug and the book of poems. For a whole week the
      Old Lady fought her pride and bitterness. Sometimes, in the hours of
      sleepless night, when all human resentments and rancours seemed petty and
      contemptible, she thought she had conquered it. But in the daytime, with
      the picture of her father looking down at her from the wall, and the
      rustle of her unfashionable dresses, worn because of Andrew Cameron&rsquo;s
      double dealing, in her ears, it got the better of her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Old Lady&rsquo;s love for Sylvia had grown so strong and deep and tender
      that no other feeling could endure finally against it. Love is a great
      miracle worker; and never had its power been more strongly made manifest
      than on the cold, dull autumn morning when the Old Lady walked to Bright
      River railway station and took the train to Charlottetown, bent on an
      errand the very thought of which turned her soul sick within her. The
      station master who sold her her ticket thought Old Lady Lloyd looked
      uncommonly white and peaked&mdash;&ldquo;as if she hadn&rsquo;t slept a wink or eaten
      a bite for a week,&rdquo; he told his wife at dinner time. &ldquo;Guess there&rsquo;s
      something wrong in her business affairs. This is the second time she&rsquo;s
      gone to town this summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Old Lady reached the town, she ate her slender little lunch and
      then walked out to the suburb where the Cameron factories and warehouses
      were. It was a long walk for her, but she could not afford to drive. She
      felt very tired when she was shown into the shining, luxurious office
      where Andrew Cameron sat at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first startled glance of surprise, he came forward beamingly,
      with outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cousin Margaret! This is a pleasant surprise. Sit down&mdash;allow
      me, this is a much more comfortable chair. Did you come in this morning?
      And how is everybody out in Spencervale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady had flushed at his first words. To hear the name by which her
      father and mother and lover had called her on Andrew Cameron&rsquo;s lips seemed
      like profanation. But, she told herself, the time was past for
      squeamishness. If she could ask a favour of Andrew Cameron, she could bear
      lesser pangs. For Sylvia&rsquo;s sake she shook hands with him, for Sylvia&rsquo;s
      sake she sat down in the chair he offered. But for no living human being&rsquo;s
      sake could this determined Old Lady infuse any cordiality into her manner
      or her words. She went straight to the point with Lloyd simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to ask a favour of you,&rdquo; she said, looking him in the eye,
      not at all humbly or meekly, as became a suppliant, but challengingly and
      defiantly, as if she dared him to refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DE-lighted to hear it, Cousin Margaret.&rdquo; Never was anything so bland and
      gracious as his tone. &ldquo;Anything I can do for you I shall be only too
      pleased to do. I am afraid you have looked upon me as an enemy, Margaret,
      and I assure you I have felt your injustice keenly. I realize that some
      appearances were against me, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady lifted her hand and stemmed his eloquence by that one
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not come here to discuss that matter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We will not refer
      to the past, if you please. I came to ask a favour, not for myself, but
      for a very dear young friend of mine&mdash;a Miss Gray, who has a
      remarkably fine voice which she wishes to have trained. She is poor, so I
      came to ask you if you would give her one of your musical scholarships. I
      understand her name has already been suggested to you, with a
      recommendation from her teacher. I do not know what he has said of her
      voice, but I do know he could hardly overrate it. If you send her abroad
      for training, you will not make any mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady stopped talking. She felt sure Andrew Cameron would grant her
      request, but she did hope he would grant it rather rudely or unwillingly.
      She could accept the favour so much more easily if it were flung to her
      like a bone to a dog. But not a bit of it. Andrew Cameron was suaver than
      ever. Nothing could give him greater pleasure than to grant his dear
      Cousin Margaret&rsquo;s request&mdash;he only wished it involved more trouble on
      his part. Her little protege should have her musical education assuredly&mdash;she
      should go abroad next year&mdash;and he was DE-lighted&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the Old Lady, cutting him short again. &ldquo;I am much
      obliged to you&mdash;and I ask you not to let Miss Gray know anything of
      my interference. And I shall not take up any more of your valuable time.
      Good afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t go so soon,&rdquo; he said, with some real kindness or
      clannishness permeating the hateful cordiality of his voice&mdash;for
      Andrew Cameron was not entirely without the homely virtues of the average
      man. He had been a good husband and father; he had once been very fond of
      his Cousin Margaret; and he was really very sorry that &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; had
      &ldquo;compelled&rdquo; him to act as he had done in that old affair of her father&rsquo;s
      investment. &ldquo;You must be my guest to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I must return home to-night,&rdquo; said the Old Lady firmly, and
      there was that in her tone which told Andrew Cameron that it would be
      useless to urge her. But he insisted on telephoning for his carriage to
      drive her to the station. The Old Lady submitted to this, because she was
      secretly afraid her own legs would not suffice to carry her there; she
      even shook hands with him at parting, and thanked him a second time for
      granting her request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Please try to think a little more kindly of me,
      Cousin Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Old Lady reached the station she found, to her dismay, that her
      train had just gone and that she would have to wait two hours for the
      evening one. She went into the waiting-room and sat down. She was very
      tired. All the excitement that had sustained her was gone, and she felt
      weak and old. She had nothing to eat, having expected to get home in time
      for tea; the waiting-room was chilly, and she shivered in her thin, old,
      silk mantilla. Her head ached and her heart likewise. She had won Sylvia&rsquo;s
      desire for her; but Sylvia would go out of her life, and the Old Lady did
      not see how she was to go on living after that. Yet she sat there
      unflinchingly for two hours, an upright, indomitable old figure, silently
      fighting her losing battle with the forces of physical and mental pain,
      while happy people came and went, and laughed and talked before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock the Old Lady got off the train at Bright River station,
      and slipped off unnoticed into the darkness of the wet night. She had two
      miles to walk, and a cold rain was falling. Soon the Old Lady was wet to
      the skin and chilled to the marrow. She felt as if she were walking in a
      bad dream. Blind instinct alone guided her over the last mile and up the
      lane to her own house. As she fumbled at her door, she realized that a
      burning heat had suddenly taken the place of her chilliness. She stumbled
      in over her threshold and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI. The October Chapter
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second morning after Old Lady Lloyd&rsquo;s journey to town, Sylvia Gray
      was walking blithely down the wood lane. It was a beautiful autumn
      morning, clear and crisp and sunny; the frosted ferns, drenched and
      battered with the rain of yesterday, gave out a delicious fragrance; here
      and there in the woods a maple waved a gay crimson banner, or a branch of
      birch showed pale golden against the dark, unchanging spruces. The air was
      very pure and exhilarating. Sylvia walked with a joyous lightness of step
      and uplift of brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beech in the hollow she paused for an expectant moment, but there
      was nothing among the gray old roots for her. She was just turning away
      when little Teddy Kimball, who lived next door to the manse, came running
      down the slope from the direction of the old Lloyd place. Teddy&rsquo;s freckled
      face was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Gray!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I guess Old Lady Lloyd has gone clean crazy
      at last. The minister&rsquo;s wife asked me to run up to the Old Lady, with a
      message about the Sewing Circle&mdash;and I knocked&mdash;and knocked&mdash;and
      nobody came&mdash;so I thought I&rsquo;d just step in and leave the letter on
      the table. But when I opened the door, I heard an awful queer laugh in the
      sitting-room, and next minute, the Old Lady came to the sitting-room door.
      Oh, Miss Gray, she looked awful. Her face was red and her eyes awful wild&mdash;and
      she was muttering and talking to herself and laughing like mad. I was so
      scared I just turned and run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, without stopping for reflection, caught Teddy&rsquo;s hand and ran up
      the slope. It did not occur to her to be frightened, although she thought
      with Teddy that the poor, lonely, eccentric Old Lady had really gone out
      of her mind at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady was sitting on the kitchen sofa when Sylvia entered. Teddy,
      too frightened to go in, lurked on the step outside. The Old Lady still
      wore the damp black silk dress in which she had walked from the station.
      Her face was flushed, her eyes wild, her voice hoarse. But she knew Sylvia
      and cowered down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Please go away&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear that
      YOU should know how poor I am. You&rsquo;re to go to Europe&mdash;Andrew Cameron
      is going to send you&mdash;I asked him&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t refuse ME. But
      please go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia did not go away. At a glance she had seen that this was sickness
      and delirium, not insanity. She sent Teddy off in hot haste for Mrs.
      Spencer and when Mrs. Spencer came they induced the Old Lady to go to bed,
      and sent for the doctor. By night everybody in Spencervale knew that Old
      Lady Lloyd had pneumonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Spencer announced that she meant to stay and nurse the Old Lady.
      Several other women offered assistance. Everybody was kind and thoughtful.
      But the Old Lady did not know it. She did not even know Sylvia Gray, who
      came and sat by her every minute she could spare. Sylvia Gray now knew all
      that she had suspected&mdash;the Old Lady was her fairy godmother. The Old
      Lady babbled of Sylvia incessantly, revealing all her love for her,
      betraying all the sacrifices she had made. Sylvia&rsquo;s heart ached with love
      and tenderness, and she prayed earnestly that the Old Lady might recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want her to know that I give her love for love,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody knew now how poor the Old Lady really was. She let slip all the
      jealously guarded secrets of her existence, except her old love for Leslie
      Gray. Even in delirium something sealed her lips as to that. But all else
      came out&mdash;her anguish over her unfashionable attire, her pitiful
      makeshifts and contrivances, her humiliation over wearing unfashionable
      dresses and paying only five cents where every other Sewing Circle member
      paid ten. The kindly women who waited on her listened to her with
      tear-filled eyes, and repented of their harsh judgments in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who would have thought it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Spencer to the minister&rsquo;s wife.
      &ldquo;Nobody ever dreamed that her father had lost ALL his money, though folks
      supposed he had lost some in that old affair of the silver mine out west.
      It&rsquo;s shocking to think of the way she has lived all these years, often
      with not enough to eat&mdash;and going to bed in winter days to save fuel.
      Though I suppose if we had known we couldn&rsquo;t have done much for her, she&rsquo;s
      so desperate proud. But if she lives, and will let us help her, things
      will be different after this. Crooked Jack says he&rsquo;ll never forgive
      himself for taking pay for the few little jobs he did for her. He says, if
      she&rsquo;ll only let him, he&rsquo;ll do everything she wants done for her after this
      for nothing. Ain&rsquo;t it strange what a fancy she&rsquo;s took to Miss Gray? Think
      of her doing all those things for her all summer, and selling the grape
      jug and all. Well, the Old Lady certainly isn&rsquo;t mean, but nobody made a
      mistake in calling her queer. It all does seem desperate pitiful. Miss
      Gray&rsquo;s taking it awful hard. She seems to think about as much of the Old
      Lady as the Old Lady thinks of her. She&rsquo;s so worked up she don&rsquo;t even seem
      to care about going to Europe next year. She&rsquo;s really going&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      had word from Andrew Cameron. I&rsquo;m awful glad, for there never was a
      sweeter girl in the world; but she says it will cost too much if the Old
      Lady&rsquo;s life is to pay for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Cameron heard of the Old Lady&rsquo;s illness and came out to Spencervale
      himself. He was not allowed to see the Old Lady, of course; but he told
      all concerned that no expense or trouble was to be spared, and the
      Spencervale doctor was instructed to send his bill to Andrew Cameron and
      hold his peace about it. Moreover, when Andrew Cameron went back home, he
      sent a trained nurse out to wait on the Old Lady, a capable, kindly woman
      who contrived to take charge of the case without offending Mrs. Spencer&mdash;than
      which no higher tribute could be paid to her tact!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady did not die&mdash;the Lloyd constitution brought her through.
      One day, when Sylvia came in, the Old Lady smiled up at her, with a weak,
      faint, sensible smile, and murmured her name, and the nurse said that the
      crisis was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady made a marvellously patient and tractable invalid. She did
      just as she was told, and accepted the presence of the nurse as a matter
      of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day, when she was strong enough to talk a little, she said to
      Sylvia,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Andrew Cameron sent Miss Hayes here, did he?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said
      Sylvia, rather timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady noticed the timidity and smiled, with something of her old
      humour and spirit in her black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time has been when I&rsquo;d have packed off unceremoniously any person Andrew
      Cameron sent here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But, Sylvia, I have gone through the Valley
      of the Shadow of Death, and I have left pride and resentment behind me for
      ever, I hope. I no longer feel as I felt towards Andrew. I can even accept
      a personal favour from him now. At last I can forgive him for the wrong he
      did me and mine. Sylvia, I find that I have been letting no ends of cats
      out of bags in my illness. Everybody knows now how poor I am&mdash;but I
      don&rsquo;t seem to mind it a bit. I&rsquo;m only sorry that I ever shut my neighbours
      out of my life because of my foolish pride. Everyone has been so kind to
      me, Sylvia. In the future, if my life is spared, it is going to be a very
      different sort of life. I&rsquo;m going to open it to all the kindness and
      companionship I can find in young and old. I&rsquo;m going to help them all I
      can and let them help me. I CAN help people&mdash;I&rsquo;ve learned that money
      isn&rsquo;t the only power for helping people. Anyone who has sympathy and
      understanding to give has a treasure that is without money and without
      price. And oh, Sylvia, you&rsquo;ve found out what I never meant you to know.
      But I don&rsquo;t mind that now, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia took the Old Lady&rsquo;s thin white hand and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never thank you enough for what you have done for me, dearest Miss
      Lloyd,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;And I am so glad that all mystery is done
      away with between us, and I can love you as much and as openly as I have
      longed to do. I am so glad and so thankful that you love me, dear fairy
      godmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know WHY I love you so?&rdquo; said the Old Lady wistfully. &ldquo;Did I let
      THAT out in my raving, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I think I know. It is because I am Leslie Gray&rsquo;s daughter, isn&rsquo;t
      it? I know that father loved you&mdash;his brother, Uncle Willis, told me
      all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoiled my own life because of my wicked pride,&rdquo; said the Old Lady
      sadly. &ldquo;But you will love me in spite of it all, won&rsquo;t you, Sylvia? And
      you will come to see me sometimes? And write me after you go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to see you every day,&rdquo; said Sylvia. &ldquo;I am going to stay in
      Spencervale for a whole year yet, just to be near you. And next year when
      I go to Europe&mdash;thanks to you, fairy godmother&mdash;I&rsquo;ll write you
      every day. We are going to be the best of chums, and we are going to have
      a most beautiful year of comradeship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Lady smiled contentedly. Out in the kitchen, the minister&rsquo;s wife,
      who had brought up a dish of jelly, was talking to Mrs. Spencer about the
      Sewing Circle. Through the open window, where the red vines hung, came the
      pungent, sun-warm October air. The sunshine fell over Sylvia&rsquo;s chestnut
      hair like a crown of glory and youth.

      &ldquo;I do feel so perfectly happy,&rdquo; said the Old Lady, with a long, rapturous
      breath.

      III. Each In His Own Tongue
    </h2>
    <p>
      The honey-tinted autumn sunshine was falling thickly over the crimson and
      amber maples around old Abel Blair&rsquo;s door. There was only one outer door
      in old Abel&rsquo;s house, and it almost always stood wide open. A little black
      dog, with one ear missing and a lame forepaw, almost always slept on the
      worn red sandstone slab which served old Abel for a doorstep; and on the
      still more worn sill above it a large gray cat almost always slept. Just
      inside the door, on a bandy-legged chair of elder days, old Abel almost
      always sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting there this afternoon&mdash;a little old man, sadly twisted
      with rheumatism; his head was abnormally large, thatched with long, wiry
      black hair; his face was heavily lined and swarthily sunburned; his eyes
      were deep-set and black, with occasional peculiar golden flashes in them.
      A strange looking man was old Abel Blair; and as strange was he as he
      looked. Lower Carmody people would have told you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Abel was almost always sober in these, his later years. He was sober
      to-day. He liked to bask in that ripe sunlight as well as his dog and cat
      did; and in such baskings he almost always looked out of his doorway at
      the far, fine blue sky over the tops of the crowding maples. But to-day he
      was not looking at the sky, instead, he was staring at the black, dusty
      rafters of his kitchen, where hung dried meats and strings of onions and
      bunches of herbs and fishing tackle and guns and skins.
    </p>
    <p>
      But old Abel saw not these things; his face was the face of a man who
      beholds visions, compact of heavenly pleasure and hellish pain, for old
      Abel was seeing what he might have been&mdash;and what he was; as he
      always saw when Felix Moore played to him on the violin. And the awful joy
      of dreaming that he was young again, with unspoiled life before him, was
      so great and compelling that it counterbalanced the agony in the
      realization of a dishonoured old age, following years in which he had
      squandered the wealth of his soul in ways where Wisdom lifted not her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix Moore was standing opposite to him, before an untidy stove, where
      the noon fire had died down into pallid, scattered ashes. Under his chin
      he held old Abel&rsquo;s brown, battered fiddle; his eyes, too, were fixed on
      the ceiling; and he, too, saw things not lawful to be uttered in any
      language save that of music; and of all music, only that given forth by
      the anguished, enraptured spirit of the violin. And yet this Felix was
      little more than twelve years old, and his face was still the face of a
      child who knows nothing of either sorrow or sin or failure or remorse.
      Only in his large, gray-black eyes was there something not of the child&mdash;something
      that spoke of an inheritance from many hearts, now ashes, which had
      aforetime grieved and joyed, and struggled and failed, and succeeded and
      grovelled. The inarticulate cries of their longings had passed into this
      child&rsquo;s soul, and transmuted themselves into the expression of his music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix was a beautiful child. Carmody people, who stayed at home, thought
      so; and old Abel Blair, who had roamed afar in many lands, thought so; and
      even the Rev. Stephen Leonard, who taught, and tried to believe, that
      favour is deceitful and beauty is vain, thought so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a slight lad, with sloping shoulders, a slim brown neck, and a head
      set on it with stag-like grace and uplift. His hair, cut straight across
      his brow and falling over his ears, after some caprice of Janet Andrews,
      the minister&rsquo;s housekeeper, was a glossy blue-black. The skin of his face
      and hands was like ivory; his eyes were large and beautifully tinted&mdash;gray,
      with dilating pupils; his features had the outlines of a cameo. Carmody
      mothers considered him delicate, and had long foretold that the minister
      would never bring him up; but old Abel pulled his grizzled moustache when
      he heard such forebodings and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix Moore will live,&rdquo; he said positively. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill that kind
      until their work is done. He&rsquo;s got a work to do&mdash;if the minister&rsquo;ll
      let him do it. And if the minister don&rsquo;t let him do it, then I wouldn&rsquo;t be
      in that minister&rsquo;s shoes when he comes to the judgment&mdash;no, I&rsquo;d
      rather be in my own. It&rsquo;s an awful thing to cross the purposes of the
      Almighty, either in your own life or anybody else&rsquo;s. Sometimes I think
      it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s meant by the unpardonable sin&mdash;ay, that I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmody people never asked what old Abel meant. They had long ago given up
      such vain questioning. When a man had lived as old Abel had lived for the
      greater part of his life, was it any wonder he said crazy things? And as
      for hinting that Mr. Leonard, a man who was really almost too good to
      live, was guilty of any sin, much less an unpardonable one&mdash;well,
      there now! what use was it to be taking any account of old Abel&rsquo;s queer
      speeches? Though, to be sure, there was no great harm in a fiddle, and
      maybe Mr. Leonard was a mite too strict that way with the child. But then,
      could you wonder at it? There was his father, you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix finally lowered the violin, and came back to old Abel&rsquo;s kitchen with
      a long sigh. Old Abel smiled drearily at him&mdash;the smile of a man who
      has been in the hands of the tormentors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful the way you play&mdash;it&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; he said with a shudder. &ldquo;I
      never heard anything like it&mdash;and you that never had any teaching
      since you were nine years old, and not much practice, except what you
      could get here now and then on my old, battered fiddle. And to think you
      make it up yourself as you go along! I suppose your grandfather would
      never hear to your studying music&mdash;would he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he wouldn&rsquo;t, Abel. He wants me to be a minister. Ministers are
      good things to be, but I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t be a minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a pulpit minister. There&rsquo;s different kinds of ministers, and each
      must talk to men in his own tongue if he&rsquo;s going to do &lsquo;em any real good,&rdquo;
       said old Abel meditatively. &ldquo;YOUR tongue is music. Strange that your
      grandfather can&rsquo;t see that for himself, and him such a broad-minded man!
      He&rsquo;s the only minister I ever had much use for. He&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s own if ever a
      man was. And he loves you&mdash;yes, sir, he loves you like the apple of
      his eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I love him,&rdquo; said Felix warmly. &ldquo;I love him so much that I&rsquo;ll even
      try to be a minister for his sake, though I don&rsquo;t want to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great violinist,&rdquo; answered the child, his ivory-hued face suddenly
      warming into living rose. &ldquo;I want to play to thousands&mdash;and see their
      eyes look as yours do when I play. Sometimes your eyes frighten me, but
      oh, it&rsquo;s a splendid fright! If I had father&rsquo;s violin I could do better. I
      remember that he once said it had a soul that was doing purgatory for its
      sins when it had lived on earth. I don&rsquo;t know what he meant, but it did
      seem to me that HIS violin was alive. He taught me to play on it as soon
      as I was big enough to hold it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you love your father?&rdquo; asked old Abel, with a keen look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Felix crimsoned; but he looked straightly and steadily into his old
      friend&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t; but,&rdquo; he added, gravely and deliberately, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think you should have asked me such a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was old Abel&rsquo;s turn to blush. Carmody people would not have believed he
      could blush; and perhaps no living being could have called that deepening
      hue into his weather-beaten cheek save only this gray-eyed child of the
      rebuking face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m always making mistakes. I&rsquo;ve
      never made anything else. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m nothing more than &lsquo;Old Abel&rsquo; to
      the Carmody people. Nobody but you and your grandfather ever calls me &lsquo;Mr.
      Blair.&rsquo; Yet William Blair at the store up there, rich and respected as he
      is, wasn&rsquo;t half as clever a man as I was when we started in life: you
      mayn&rsquo;t believe that, but it&rsquo;s true. And the worst of it is, young Felix,
      that most of the time I don&rsquo;t care whether I&rsquo;m Mr. Blair or old Abel. Only
      when you play I care. It makes me feel just as a look I saw in a little
      girl&rsquo;s eyes some years ago made me feel. Her name was Anne Shirley and she
      lived with the Cuthberts down at Avonlea. We got into a conversation at
      Blair&rsquo;s store. She could talk a blue streak to anyone, that girl could. I
      happened to say about something that it didn&rsquo;t matter to a battered old
      hulk of sixty odd like me. She looked at me with her big, innocent eyes, a
      little reproachful like, as if I&rsquo;d said something awful heretical. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you think, Mr. Blair,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;that the older we get the more things
      ought to matter to us?&rsquo;&mdash;as grave as if she&rsquo;d been a hundred instead
      of eleven. &lsquo;Things matter SO much to me now,&rsquo; she says, clasping her hands
      thisaway, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m sure that when I&rsquo;m sixty they&rsquo;ll matter just five times
      as much to me.&rsquo; Well, the way she looked and the way she spoke made me
      feel downright ashamed of myself because things had stopped mattering with
      me. But never mind all that. My miserable old feelings don&rsquo;t count for
      much. What come of your father&rsquo;s fiddle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather took it away when I came here. I think he burned it. And I
      long for it so often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve always got my old brown fiddle to come to when you must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. And I&rsquo;m glad for that. But I&rsquo;m hungry for a violin all the
      time. And I only come here when the hunger gets too much to bear. I feel
      as if I oughtn&rsquo;t to come even then&mdash;I&rsquo;m always saying I won&rsquo;t do it
      again, because I know grandfather wouldn&rsquo;t like it, if he knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never forbidden it, has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but that is because he doesn&rsquo;t know I come here for that. He never
      thinks of such a thing. I feel sure he WOULD forbid it, if he knew. And
      that makes me very wretched. And yet I HAVE to come. Mr. Blair, do you
      know why grandfather can&rsquo;t bear to have me play on the violin? He loves
      music, and he doesn&rsquo;t mind my playing on the organ, if I don&rsquo;t neglect
      other things. I can&rsquo;t understand it, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a pretty good idea, but I can&rsquo;t tell you. It isn&rsquo;t my secret.
      Maybe he&rsquo;ll tell you himself some day. But, mark you, young Felix, he has
      got good reasons for it all. Knowing what I know, I can&rsquo;t blame him over
      much, though I think he&rsquo;s mistaken. Come now, play something more for me
      before you go&mdash;something that&rsquo;s bright and happy this time, so as to
      leave me with a good taste in my mouth. That last thing you played took me
      straight to heaven,&mdash;but heaven&rsquo;s awful near to hell, and at the last
      you tipped me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said Felix, drawing his fine, narrow black brows
      together in a perplexed frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;and I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to. You couldn&rsquo;t understand unless you
      was an old man who had it in him once to do something and be a MAN, and
      just went and made himself a devilish fool. But there must be something in
      you that understands things&mdash;all kinds of things&mdash;or you
      couldn&rsquo;t put it all into music the way you do. How do you do it? How in&mdash;how
      DO you do it, young Felix?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I play differently to different people. I don&rsquo;t know
      how that is. When I&rsquo;m alone with you I have to play one way; and when
      Janet comes over here to listen I feel quite another way&mdash;not so
      thrilling, but happier and lonelier. And that day when Jessie Blair was
      here listening I felt as if I wanted to laugh and sing&mdash;as if the
      violin wanted to laugh and sing all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strange, golden gleam flashed through old Abel&rsquo;s sunken eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God,&rdquo; he muttered under his breath, &ldquo;I believe the boy can get into other
      folk&rsquo;s souls somehow, and play out what HIS soul sees there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; inquired Felix, petting his fiddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;never mind&mdash;go on. Something lively now, young Felix.
      Stop probing into my soul, where you haven&rsquo;t no business to be, you
      infant, and play me something out of your own&mdash;something sweet and
      happy and pure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play the way I feel on sunshiny mornings, when the birds are singing
      and I forget I have to be a minister,&rdquo; said Felix simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      A witching, gurgling, mirthful strain, like mingled bird and brook song,
      floated out on the still air, along the path where the red and golden
      maple leaves were falling very softly, one by one. The Reverend Stephen
      Leonard heard it, as he came along the way, and the Reverend Stephen
      Leonard smiled. Now, when Stephen Leonard smiled, children ran to him, and
      grown people felt as if they looked from Pisgah over to some fair land of
      promise beyond the fret and worry of their care-dimmed earthly lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard loved music, as he loved all things beautiful, whether in the
      material or the spiritual world, though he did not realize how much he
      loved them for their beauty alone, or he would have been shocked and
      remorseful. He himself was beautiful. His figure was erect and youthful,
      despite seventy years. His face was as mobile and charming as a woman&rsquo;s,
      yet with all a man&rsquo;s tried strength and firmness in it, and his dark blue
      eyes flashed with the brilliance of one and twenty; even his silken
      silvery hair could not make an old man of him. He was worshipped by
      everyone who knew him, and he was, in so far as mortal man may be, worthy
      of that worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Abel is amusing himself with his violin again,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;What a
      delicious thing he is playing! He has quite a gift for the violin. But how
      can he play such a thing as that,&mdash;a battered old hulk of a man who
      has, at one time or another, wallowed in almost every sin to which human
      nature can sink? He was on one of his sprees three days ago&mdash;the
      first one for over a year&mdash;lying dead-drunk in the market square in
      Charlottetown among the dogs; and now he is playing something that only a
      young archangel on the hills of heaven ought to be able to play. Well, it
      will make my task all the easier. Abel is always repentant by the time he
      is able to play on his fiddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard was on the door-stone. The little black dog had frisked down
      to meet him, and the gray cat rubbed her head against his leg. Old Abel
      did not notice him; he was beating time with uplifted hand and smiling
      face to Felix&rsquo;s music, and his eyes were young again, glowing with
      laughter and sheer happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix! what does this mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The violin bow clattered from Felix&rsquo;s hand upon the floor; he swung around
      and faced his grandfather. As he met the passion of grief and hurt in the
      old man&rsquo;s eyes, his own clouded with an agony of repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he cried brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now!&rdquo; Old Abel had risen deprecatingly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault, Mr.
      Leonard. Don&rsquo;t you blame the boy. I coaxed him to play a bit for me. I
      didn&rsquo;t feel fit to touch the fiddle yet myself&mdash;too soon after
      Friday, you see. So I coaxed him on&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t give him no peace till
      he played. It&rsquo;s all my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Felix, throwing back his head. His face was as white as marble,
      yet it seemed ablaze with desperate truth and scorn of old Abel&rsquo;s
      shielding lie. &ldquo;No, grandfather, it isn&rsquo;t Abel&rsquo;s fault. I came over here
      on purpose to play, because I thought you had gone to the harbour. I have
      come here often, ever since I have lived with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since you have lived with me you have been deceiving me like this,
      Felix?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no anger in Mr. Leonard&rsquo;s tone&mdash;only measureless sorrow.
      The boy&rsquo;s sensitive lips quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, grandfather,&rdquo; he whispered beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never forbid him to come,&rdquo; old Abel broke in angrily. &ldquo;Be just, Mr.
      Leonard&mdash;be just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I AM just. Felix knows that he has disobeyed me, in the spirit if not in
      the letter. Do you not know it, Felix?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, grandfather, I have done wrong&mdash;I&rsquo;ve known that I was doing
      wrong every time I came. Forgive me, grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix, I forgive you, but I ask you to promise me, here and now, that you
      will never again, as long as you live, touch a violin.&rdquo; Dusky crimson
      rushed madly over the boy&rsquo;s face. He gave a cry as if he had been lashed
      with a whip. Old Abel sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ask such a promise of him, Mr. Leonard,&rdquo; he cried furiously.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sin, that&rsquo;s what it is. Man, man, what blinds you? You ARE blind.
      Can&rsquo;t you see what is in the boy? His soul is full of music. It&rsquo;ll torture
      him to death&mdash;or to worse&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t let it have way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a devil in such music,&rdquo; said Mr. Leonard hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, there may be, but don&rsquo;t forget that there&rsquo;s a Christ in it, too,&rdquo;
       retorted old Abel in a low tense tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard looked shocked; he considered that old Abel had uttered
      blasphemy. He turned away from him rebukingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix, promise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no relenting in his face or tone. He was merciless in the use of
      the power he possessed over that young, loving spirit. Felix understood
      that there was no escape; but his lips were very white as he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise, grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard drew a long breath of relief. He knew that promise would be
      kept. So did old Abel. The latter crossed the floor and sullenly took the
      violin from Felix&rsquo;s relaxed hand. Without a word or look he went into the
      little bedroom off the kitchen and shut the door with a slam of righteous
      indignation. But from its window he stealthily watched his visitors go
      away. Just as they entered on the maple path Mr. Leonard laid his hand on
      Felix&rsquo;s head and looked down at him. Instantly the boy flung his arm up
      over the old man&rsquo;s shoulder and smiled at him. In the look they exchanged
      there was boundless love and trust&mdash;ay, and good-fellowship. Old
      Abel&rsquo;s scornful eyes again held the golden flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How those two love each other!&rdquo; he muttered enviously. &ldquo;And how they
      torture each other!&rdquo;
     </p>

      Mr. Leonard went to his study to pray when he got home. He knew that Felix
      had run for comforting to Janet Andrews, the little, thin, sweet-faced,
      rigid-lipped woman who kept house for them. Mr. Leonard knew that Janet
      would disapprove of his action as deeply as old Abel had done. She would
      say nothing, she would only look at him with reproachful eyes over the
      teacups at suppertime. But Mr. Leonard believed he had done what was best
      and his conscience did not trouble him, though his heart did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirteen years before this, his daughter Margaret had almost broken that
      heart by marrying a man of whom he could not approve. Martin Moore was a
      professional violinist. He was a popular performer, though not in any
      sense a great one. He met the slim, golden-haired daughter of the manse at
      the house of a college friend she was visiting in Toronto, and fell
      straightway in love with her. Margaret had loved him with all her virginal
      heart in return, and married him, despite her father&rsquo;s disapproval. It was
      not to Martin Moore&rsquo;s profession that Mr. Leonard objected, but to the man
      himself. He knew that the violinist&rsquo;s past life had not been such as
      became a suitor for Margaret Leonard; and his insight into character
      warned him that Martin Moore could never make any woman lastingly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Leonard did not believe this. She married Martin Moore and lived
      one year in paradise. Perhaps that atoned for the three bitter years which
      followed&mdash;that, and her child. At all events, she died as she had
      lived, loyal and uncomplaining. She died alone, for her husband was away
      on a concert tour, and her illness was so brief that her father had not
      time to reach her before the end. Her body was taken home to be buried
      beside her mother in the little Carmody churchyard. Mr. Leonard wished to
      take the child, but Martin Moore refused to give him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six years later Moore, too, died, and at last Mr. Leonard had his heart&rsquo;s
      desire&mdash;the possession of Margaret&rsquo;s son. The grandfather awaited the
      child&rsquo;s coming with mingled feelings. His heart yearned for him, yet he
      dreaded to meet a second edition of Martin Moore. Suppose Margaret&rsquo;s son
      resembled his handsome vagabond of a father! Or, worse still, suppose he
      were cursed with his father&rsquo;s lack of principle, his instability, his
      Bohemian instincts. Thus Mr. Leonard tortured himself wretchedly before
      the coming of Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child did not look like either father or mother. Instead, Mr. Leonard
      found himself looking into a face which he had put away under the grasses
      thirty years before&mdash;the face of his girl bride, who had died at
      Margaret&rsquo;s birth. Here again were her lustrous gray-black eyes, her ivory
      outlines, her fine-traced arch of brow; and here, looking out of those
      eyes, seemed her very spirit again. From that moment the soul of the old
      man was knit to the soul of the child, and they loved each other with a
      love surpassing that of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix&rsquo;s only inheritance from his father was his love of music. But the
      child had genius, where his father had possessed only talent. To Martin
      Moore&rsquo;s outward mastery of the violin was added the mystery and intensity
      of his mother&rsquo;s nature, with some more subtle quality still, which had
      perhaps come to him from the grandmother he so strongly resembled. Moore
      had understood what a career was naturally before the child, and he had
      trained him in the technique of his art from the time the slight fingers
      could first grasp the bow. When nine-year-old Felix came to the Carmody
      manse, he had mastered as much of the science of the violin as nine out of
      ten musicians acquire in a lifetime; and he brought with him his father&rsquo;s
      violin; it was all Martin Moore had to leave his son&mdash;but it was an
      Amati, the commercial value of which nobody in Carmody suspected. Mr.
      Leonard had taken possession of it and Felix had never seen it since. He
      cried himself to sleep many a night for the loss of it. Mr. Leonard did
      not know this, and if Janet Andrews suspected it she held her tongue&mdash;an
      art in which she excelled. She &ldquo;saw no harm in a fiddle,&rdquo; herself, and
      thought Mr. Leonard absurdly strict in the matter, though it would not
      have been well for the luckless outsider who might have ventured to say as
      much to her. She had connived at Felix&rsquo;s visits to old Abel Blair,
      squaring the matter with her Presbyterian conscience by some peculiar
      process known only to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Janet heard of the promise which Mr. Leonard had exacted from Felix
      she seethed with indignation; and, though she &ldquo;knew her place&rdquo; better than
      to say anything to Mr. Leonard about it, she made her disapproval so
      plainly manifest in her bearing that the stern, gentle old man found the
      atmosphere of his hitherto peaceful manse unpleasantly chill and hostile
      for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the wish of his heart that Felix should be a minister, as he would
      have wished his own son to be, had one been born to him. Mr. Leonard
      thought rightly that the highest work to which any man could be called was
      a life of service to his fellows; but he made the mistake of supposing the
      field of service much narrower than it is&mdash;of failing to see that a
      man may minister to the needs of humanity in many different but equally
      effective ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet hoped that Mr. Leonard might not exact the fulfilment of Felix&rsquo;s
      promise; but Felix himself, with the instinctive understanding of perfect
      love, knew that it was vain to hope for any change of viewpoint in his
      grandfather. He addressed himself to the keeping of his promise in letter
      and in spirit. He never went again to old Abel&rsquo;s; he did not even play on
      the organ, though this was not forbidden, because any music wakened in him
      a passion of longing and ecstasy which demanded expression with an
      intensity not to be borne. He flung himself grimly into his studies and
      conned Latin and Greek verbs with a persistency which soon placed him at
      the head of all competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once in the long winter did he come near to breaking his promise. One
      evening, when March was melting into April, and the pulses of spring were
      stirring under the lingering snow, he was walking home from school alone.
      As he descended into the little hollow below the manse a lively lilt of
      music drifted up to meet him. It was only the product of a mouth-organ,
      manipulated by a little black-eyed, French-Canadian hired boy, sitting on
      the fence by the brook; but there was music in the ragged urchin and it
      came out through his simple toy. It tingled over Felix from head to foot;
      and, when Leon held out the mouth-organ with a fraternal grin of
      invitation, he snatched at it as a famished creature might snatch at food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with it half-way to his lips, he paused. True, it was only the
      violin he had promised never to touch; but he felt that if he gave way
      ever so little to the desire that was in him, it would sweep everything
      before it. If he played on Leon Buote&rsquo;s mouth-organ, there in that misty
      spring dale, he would go to old Abel&rsquo;s that evening; he KNEW he would go.
      To Leon&rsquo;s amazement, Felix threw the mouth-organ back at him and ran up
      the hill as if he were pursued. There was something in his boyish face
      that frightened Leon; and it frightened Janet Andrews as Felix rushed past
      her in the hall of the manse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Are you sick? Have you
      been scared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Leave me alone, Janet,&rdquo; said Felix chokingly, dashing up the
      stairs to his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite composed when he came down to tea, an hour later, though he
      was unusually pale and had purple shadows under his large eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard scrutinized him somewhat anxiously; it suddenly occurred to
      the old minister that Felix was looking more delicate than his wont this
      spring. Well, he had studied hard all winter, and he was certainly growing
      very fast. When vacation came he must be sent away for a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me Naomi Clark is real sick,&rdquo; said Janet. &ldquo;She has been ailing
      all winter, and now she&rsquo;s fast to her bed. Mrs. Murphy says she believes
      the woman is dying, but nobody dares tell her so. She won&rsquo;t give in she&rsquo;s
      sick, nor take medicine. And there&rsquo;s nobody to wait on her except that
      simple creature, Maggie Peterson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I ought to go and see her,&rdquo; said Mr. Leonard uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What use would it be to bother yourself? You know she wouldn&rsquo;t see you&mdash;she&rsquo;d
      shut the door in your face like she did before. She&rsquo;s an awful wicked
      woman&mdash;but it&rsquo;s kind of terrible to think of her lying there sick,
      with no responsible person to tend her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naomi Clark is a bad woman and she lived a life of shame, but I like her,
      for all that,&rdquo; remarked Felix, in the grave, meditative tone in which he
      occasionally said rather startling things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard looked somewhat reproachfully at Janet Andrews, as if to ask
      her why Felix should have attained to this dubious knowledge of good and
      evil under her care; and Janet shot a dour look back which, being
      interpreted, meant that if Felix went to the district school she could not
      and would not be held responsible if he learned more there than arithmetic
      and Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know of Naomi Clark to like or dislike?&rdquo; she asked curiously.
      &ldquo;Did you ever see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Felix replied, addressing himself to his cherry preserve with
      considerable gusto. &ldquo;I was down at Spruce Cove one night last summer when
      a big thunderstorm came up. I went to Naomi&rsquo;s house for shelter. The door
      was open, so I walked right in, because nobody answered my knock. Naomi
      Clark was at the window, watching the cloud coming up over the sea. She
      just looked at me once, but didn&rsquo;t say anything, and then went on watching
      the cloud. I didn&rsquo;t like to sit down because she hadn&rsquo;t asked me to, so I
      went to the window by her and watched it, too. It was a dreadful sight&mdash;the
      cloud was so black and the water so green, and there was such a strange
      light between the cloud and the water; yet there was something splendid in
      it, too. Part of the time I watched the storm, and the other part I
      watched Naomi&rsquo;s face. It was dreadful to see, like the storm, and yet I
      liked to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the thunder was over it rained a while longer, and Naomi sat down
      and talked to me. She asked me who I was, and when I told her she asked me
      to play something for her on her violin,&rdquo;&mdash;Felix shot a deprecating
      glance at Mr. Leonard&mdash;&ldquo;because, she said, she&rsquo;d heard I was a great
      hand at it. She wanted something lively, and I tried just as hard as I
      could to play something like that. But I couldn&rsquo;t. I played something that
      was terrible&mdash;it just played itself&mdash;it seemed as if something
      was lost that could never be found again. And before I got through, Naomi
      came at me, and tore the violin from me, and&mdash;SWORE. And she said,
      &lsquo;You big-eyed brat, how did you know THAT?&rsquo; Then she took me by the arm&mdash;and
      she hurt me, too, I can tell you&mdash;and she put me right out in the
      rain and slammed the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rude, unmannerly creature!&rdquo; said Janet indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, she was quite in the right,&rdquo; said Felix composedly. &ldquo;It served me
      right for what I played. You see, she didn&rsquo;t know I couldn&rsquo;t help playing
      it. I suppose she thought I did it on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth did you play, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Felix shivered. &ldquo;It was awful&mdash;it was dreadful. It
      was fit to break your heart. But it HAD to be played, if I played anything
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean&mdash;I declare I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Janet in
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll change the subject of conversation,&rdquo; said Mr. Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a month later when &ldquo;the simple creature, Maggie&rdquo; appeared at the
      manse door one evening and asked for the preached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naomi wants ter see yer,&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;Naomi sent Maggie ter tell yer
      ter come at onct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go, certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Leonard gently. &ldquo;Is she very ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her&rsquo;s dying,&rdquo; said Maggie with a broad grin. &ldquo;And her&rsquo;s awful skeered of
      hell. Her just knew ter-day her was dying. Maggie told her&mdash;her
      wouldn&rsquo;t believe the harbour women, but her believed Maggie. Her yelled
      awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maggie chuckled to herself over the gruesome remembrance. Mr. Leonard, his
      heart filled with pity, called Janet and told her to give the poor
      creature some refreshment. But Maggie shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, preacher, Maggie must get right back to Naomi. Maggie&rsquo;ll tell her
      the preacher&rsquo;s coming ter save her from hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered an eerie cry, and ran at full speed shoreward through the
      spruce woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord save us!&rdquo; said Janet in an awed tone. &ldquo;I knew the poor girl was
      simple, but I didn&rsquo;t know she was like THAT. And are you going, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course. I pray God I may be able to help the poor soul,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Leonard sincerely. He was a man who never shirked what he believed to be
      his duty; but duty had sometimes presented itself to him in pleasanter
      guise than this summons to Naomi Clark&rsquo;s death-bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman had been the plague spot of Lower Carmody and Carmody Harbour
      for a generation. In the earlier days of his ministry to the congregation
      he had tried to reclaim her, and Naomi had mocked and flouted him to his
      face. Then, for the sake of those to whom she was a snare or a
      heart-break, he had endeavoured to set the law in motion against her, and
      Naomi had laughed the law to scorn. Finally, he had been compelled to let
      her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Naomi had not always been an outcast. Her girlhood had been innocent;
      but she was the possessor of a dangerous beauty, and her mother was dead.
      Her father was a man notorious for his harshness and violence of temper.
      When Naomi made the fatal mistake of trusting to a false love that
      betrayed and deserted, he drove her from his door with taunts and curses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naomi took up her quarters in a little deserted house at Spruce Cove. Had
      her child lived it might have saved her. But it died at birth, and with
      its little life went her last chance of worldly redemption. From that time
      forth, her feet were set in the way that takes hold on hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past five years, however, Naomi had lived a tolerably respectable
      life. When Janet Peterson had died, her idiot daughter, Maggie, had been
      left with no kin in the world. Nobody knew what was to be done with her,
      for nobody wanted to be bothered with her. Naomi Clark went to the girl
      and offered her a home. People said she was no fit person to have charge
      of Maggie, but everybody shirked the unpleasant task of interfering in the
      matter, except Mr. Leonard, who went to expostulate with Naomi, and, as
      Janet said, for his pains got her door shut in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from the day when Maggie Peterson went to live with her, Naomi ceased
      to be the harbour Magdalen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set when Mr. Leonard reached Spruce Cove, and the harbour was
      veiling itself in a wondrous twilight splendour. Afar out, the sea lay
      throbbing and purple, and the moan of the bar came through the sweet,
      chill spring air with its burden of hopeless, endless longing and seeking.
      The sky was blossoming into stars above the afterglow; out to the east the
      moon was rising, and the sea beneath it was a thing of radiance and silver
      and glamour; and a little harbour boat that went sailing across it was
      transmuted into an elfin shallop from the coast of fairyland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard sighed as he turned from the sinless beauty of the sea and sky
      to the threshold of Naomi Clark&rsquo;s house. It was very small&mdash;one room
      below, and a sleeping-loft above; but a bed had been made up for the sick
      woman by the down-stairs window looking out on the harbour; and Naomi lay
      on it, with a lamp burning at her head and another at her side, although
      it was not yet dark. A great dread of darkness had always been one of
      Naomi&rsquo;s peculiarities.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was tossing restlessly on her poor couch, while Maggie crouched on a
      box at the foot. Mr. Leonard had not seen her for five years, and he was
      shocked at the change in her. She was much wasted; her clear-cut, aquiline
      features had been of the type which becomes indescribably witch-like in
      old age, and, though Naomi Clark was barely sixty, she looked as if she
      might be a hundred. Her hair streamed over the pillow in white,
      uncared-for tresses, and the hands that plucked at the bed-clothes were
      like wrinkled claws. Only her eyes were unchanged; they were as blue and
      brilliant as ever, but now filled with such agonized terror and appeal
      that Mr. Leonard&rsquo;s gentle heart almost stood still with the horror of
      them. They were the eyes of a creature driven wild with torture, hounded
      by furies, clutched by unutterable fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naomi sat up and dragged at his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you help me? Can you help me?&rdquo; she gasped imploringly. &ldquo;Oh, I thought
      you&rsquo;d never come! I was skeered I&rsquo;d die before you got here&mdash;die and
      go to hell. I didn&rsquo;t know before today that I was dying. None of those
      cowards would tell me. Can you help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I cannot, God can,&rdquo; said Mr. Leonard gently. He felt himself very
      helpless and inefficient before this awful terror and frenzy. He had seen
      sad death-beds&mdash;troubled death-beds&mdash;ay, and despairing
      death-beds, but never anything like this. &ldquo;God!&rdquo; Naomi&rsquo;s voice shrilled
      terribly as she uttered the name. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to God for help. Oh, I&rsquo;m
      skeered of hell, but I&rsquo;m skeereder still of God. I&rsquo;d rather go to hell a
      thousand times over than face God after the life I&rsquo;ve lived. I tell you,
      I&rsquo;m sorry for living wicked&mdash;I was always sorry for it all the time.
      There ain&rsquo;t never been a moment I wasn&rsquo;t sorry, though nobody would
      believe it. I was driven on by fiends of hell. Oh, you don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;you
      CAN&rsquo;T understand&mdash;but I was always sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you repent, that is all that is necessary. God will forgive you if you
      ask Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, He can&rsquo;t! Sins like mine can&rsquo;t be forgiven. He can&rsquo;t&mdash;and He
      won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can and He will. He is a God of love, Naomi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Naomi with stubborn conviction. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a God of love at all.
      That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m skeered of him. No, no. He&rsquo;s a God of wrath and justice and
      punishment. Love! There ain&rsquo;t no such thing as love! I&rsquo;ve never found it
      on earth, and I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s to be found in God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naomi, God loves us like a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like MY father?&rdquo; Naomi&rsquo;s shrill laughter, pealing through the still room,
      was hideous to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old minister shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no! As a kind, tender, all-wise father, Naomi&mdash;as you would
      have loved your little child if it had lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naomi cowered and moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wish I could believe THAT. I wouldn&rsquo;t be frightened if I could
      believe that. MAKE me believe it. Surely you can make me believe that
      there&rsquo;s love and forgiveness in God if you believe it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jesus Christ forgave and loved the Magdalen, Naomi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jesus Christ? Oh, I ain&rsquo;t afraid of HIM. Yes, HE could understand and
      forgive. He was half human. I tell you, it&rsquo;s God I&rsquo;m skeered of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are one and the same,&rdquo; said Mr. Leonard helplessly. He knew he could
      not make Naomi realize it. This anguished death-bed was no place for a
      theological exposition on the mysteries of the Trinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christ died for you, Naomi. He bore your sins in His own body on the
      cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We bear our own sins,&rdquo; said Naomi fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve borne mine all my life&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ll bear them for all eternity. I can&rsquo;t believe anything else. I CAN&rsquo;T
      believe God can forgive me. I&rsquo;ve ruined people body and soul&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      broken hearts and poisoned homes&mdash;I&rsquo;m worse than a murderess. No&mdash;no&mdash;no,
      there&rsquo;s no hope for me.&rdquo; Her voice rose again into that shrill,
      intolerable shriek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go to hell. It ain&rsquo;t so much the fire I&rsquo;m
      skeered of as the outer darkness. I&rsquo;ve always been so skeered of darkness&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      so full of awful things and thoughts. Oh, there ain&rsquo;t nobody to help me!
      Man ain&rsquo;t no good and I&rsquo;m too skeered of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrung her hands. Mr. Leonard walked up and down the room in the
      keenest anguish of spirit he had ever known. What could he do? What could
      he say? There was healing and peace in his religion for this woman as for
      all others, but he could express it in no language which this tortured
      soul could understand. He looked at her writhing face; he looked at the
      idiot girl chuckling to herself at the foot of the bed; he looked through
      the open door to the remote, starlit night&mdash;and a horrible sense of
      utter helplessness overcame him. He could do nothing&mdash;nothing! In all
      his life he had never known such bitterness of soul as the realization
      brought home to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of you if you can&rsquo;t help me?&rdquo; moaned the dying woman.
      &ldquo;Pray&mdash;pray&mdash;pray!&rdquo; she shrilled suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard dropped on his knees by the bed. He did not know what to say.
      No prayer that he had ever prayed was of use here. The old, beautiful
      formulas, which had soothed and helped the passing of many a soul, were
      naught save idle, empty words to Naomi Clark. In his anguish of mind
      Stephen Leonard gasped out the briefest and sincerest prayer his lips had
      ever uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, God, our Father! Help this woman. Speak to her in a tongue which she
      can understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A beautiful, white face appeared for a moment in the light that streamed
      out of the doorway into the darkness of the night. No one noticed it, and
      it quickly drew back into the shadow. Suddenly, Naomi fell back on her
      pillow, her lips blue, her face horribly pinched, her eyes rolled up in
      her head. Maggie started up, pushed Mr. Leonard aside, and proceeded to
      administer some remedy with surprising skill and deftness. Mr. Leonard,
      believing Naomi to be dying, went to the door, feeling sick and bruised in
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a figure stole out into the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix, is that you?&rdquo; said Mr. Leonard in a startled tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Felix came up to the stone step. &ldquo;Janet got frightened that
      you might fall on that rough road after dark, so she made me come after
      you with a lantern. I&rsquo;ve been waiting behind the point, but at last I
      thought I&rsquo;d better come and see if you would be staying much longer. If
      you will be, I&rsquo;ll go back to Janet and leave the lantern here with you.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Yes, that will be the best thing to do. I may not be ready to go home for
      some time yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Leonard, thinking that the death-bed of sin
      behind him was no sight for Felix&rsquo;s young eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your grandson you&rsquo;re talking to?&rdquo; Naomi spoke clearly and
      strongly. The spasm had passed. &ldquo;If it is, bring him in. I want to see
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly, Mr. Leonard signed Felix to enter. The boy stood by Naomi&rsquo;s
      bed and looked down at her with sympathetic eyes. But at first she did not
      look at him&mdash;she looked past him at the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have died in that spell,&rdquo; she said, with sullen reproach in her
      voice, &ldquo;and if I had, I&rsquo;d been in hell now. You can&rsquo;t help me&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      done with you. There ain&rsquo;t any hope for me, and I know it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take down that fiddle on the wall and play something for me,&rdquo; she said
      imperiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to hell&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t want
      to think of it. Play me something to take my thoughts off it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      care what you play. I was always fond of music&mdash;there was always
      something in it for me I never found anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked at his grandfather. The old man nodded, he felt too ashamed
      to speak; he sat with his fine silver head in his hands, while Felix took
      down and tuned the old violin, on which so many godless lilts had been
      played in many a wild revel. Mr. Leonard felt that he had failed his
      religion. He could not give Naomi the help that was in it for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix drew the bow softly, perplexedly over the strings. He had no idea
      what he should play. Then his eyes were caught and held by Naomi&rsquo;s
      burning, mesmeric, blue gaze as she lay on her crumpled pillow. A strange,
      inspired look came over the boy&rsquo;s face. He began to play as if it were not
      he who played, but some mightier power, of which he was but the passive
      instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet and soft and wonderful was the music that stole through the room.
      Mr. Leonard forgot his heartbreak and listened to it in puzzled amazement.
      He had never heard anything like it before. How could the child play like
      that? He looked at Naomi and marvelled at the change in her face. The fear
      and frenzy were going out of it; she listened breathlessly, never taking
      her eyes from Felix. At the foot of the bed the idiot girl sat with tears
      on her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that strange music was the joy of the innocent, mirthful childhood,
      blent with the laughter of waves and the call of glad winds. Then it held
      the wild, wayward dreams of youth, sweet and pure in all their wildness
      and waywardness. They were followed by a rapture of young love&mdash;all-surrendering,
      all-sacrificing love. The music changed. It held the torture of unshed
      tears, the anguish of a heart deceived and desolate. Mr. Leonard almost
      put his hands over his ears to shut out its intolerable poignancy. But on
      the dying woman&rsquo;s face was only a strange relief, as if some dumb,
      long-hidden pain had at last won to the healing of utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sullen indifference of despair came next, the bitterness of
      smouldering revolt and misery, the reckless casting away of all good.
      There was something indescribably evil in the music now&mdash;so evil that
      Mr. Leonard&rsquo;s white soul shuddered away in loathing, and Maggie cowered
      and whined like a frightened animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the music changed. And in it now there was agony and fear&mdash;and
      repentance and a cry for pardon. To Mr. Leonard there was something
      strangely familiar in it. He struggled to recall where he had heard it
      before; then he suddenly knew&mdash;he had heard it before Felix came in
      Naomi&rsquo;s terrible words! He looked at his grandson with something like awe.
      Here was a power of which he knew nothing&mdash;a strange and dreadful
      power. Was it of God? Or of Satan?
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last time the music changed. And now it was not music at all&mdash;it
      was a great, infinite forgiveness, an all-comprehending love. It was
      healing for a sick soul; it was light and hope and peace. A Bible text,
      seemingly incongruous, came into Mr. Leonard&rsquo;s mind&mdash;&ldquo;This is the
      house of God; this is the gate of heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix lowered the violin and dropped wearily on a chair by the bed. The
      inspired light faded from his face; once more he was only a tired boy. But
      Stephen Leonard was on his knees, sobbing like a child; and Naomi Clark
      was lying still, with her hands clasped over her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand now,&rdquo; she said very softly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see it before&mdash;and
      now it&rsquo;s so plain. I just FEEL it. God IS a God of love. He can forgive
      anybody&mdash;even me&mdash;even me. He knows all about it. I ain&rsquo;t
      skeered any more. He just loves me and forgives me as I&rsquo;d have loved and
      forgiven my baby if she&rsquo;d lived, no matter how bad she was, or what she
      did. The minister told me that but I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I KNOW it now.
      And He sent you here to-night, boy, to tell it to me in a way that I could
      feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naomi Clark died just as the dawn came up over the sea. Mr. Leonard rose
      from his watch at her bedside and went to the door. Before him spread the
      harbour, gray and austere in the faint light, but afar out the sun was
      rending asunder the milk-white mists in which the sea was scarfed, and
      under it was a virgin glow of sparkling water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fir trees on the point moved softly and whispered together. The whole
      world sang of spring and resurrection and life; and behind him Naomi
      Clark&rsquo;s dead face took on the peace that passes understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old minister and his grandson walked home together in a silence that
      neither wished to break. Janet Andrews gave them a good scolding and an
      excellent breakfast. Then she ordered them both to bed; but Mr. Leonard,
      smiling at her, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently, Janet, presently. But now, take this key, go up to the black
      chest in the garret, and bring me what you will find there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Janet had gone, he turned to Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix, would you like to study music as your life-work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked up, with a transfiguring flush on his wan face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, grandfather! Oh, grandfather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may do so, my child. After this night I dare not hinder you. Go with
      my blessing, and may God guide and keep you, and make you strong to do His
      work and tell His message to humanity in your own appointed way. It is not
      the way I desired for you&mdash;but I see that I was mistaken. Old Abel
      spoke truly when he said there was a Christ in your violin as well as a
      devil. I understand what he meant now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to meet Janet, who came into the study with a violin. Felix&rsquo;s
      heart throbbed; he recognized it. Mr. Leonard took it from Janet and held
      it out to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is your father&rsquo;s violin, Felix. See to it that you never make your
      music the servant of the power of evil&mdash;never debase it to unworthy
      ends. For your responsibility is as your gift, and God will exact the
      accounting of it from you. Speak to the world in your own tongue through
      it, with truth and sincerity; and all I have hoped for you will be
      abundantly fulfilled.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IV. Little Joscelyn
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It simply isn&rsquo;t to be thought of, Aunty Nan,&rdquo; said Mrs. William Morrison
      decisively. Mrs. William Morrison was one of those people who always speak
      decisively. If they merely announce that they are going to peel the
      potatoes for dinner their hearers realize that there is no possible escape
      for the potatoes. Moreover, these people are always given their full title
      by everybody. William Morrison was called Billy oftener than not; but, if
      you had asked for Mrs. Billy Morrison, nobody in Avonlea would have known
      what you meant at first guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must see that for yourself, Aunty,&rdquo; went on Mrs. William, hulling
      strawberries nimbly with her large, firm, white fingers as she talked.
      Mrs. William always improved every shining moment. &ldquo;It is ten miles to
      Kensington, and just think how late you would be getting back. You are not
      able for such a drive. You wouldn&rsquo;t get over it for a month. You know you
      are anything but strong this summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunty Nan sighed, and patted the tiny, furry, gray morsel of a kitten in
      her lap with trembling fingers. She knew, better than anyone else could
      know it, that she was not strong that summer. In her secret soul, Aunty
      Nan, sweet and frail and timid under the burden of her seventy years, felt
      with mysterious unmistakable prescience that it was to be her last summer
      at the Gull Point Farm. But that was only the more reason why she should
      go to hear little Joscelyn sing; she would never have another chance. And
      oh, to hear little Joscelyn sing just once&mdash;Joscelyn, whose voice was
      delighting thousands out in the big world, just as in the years gone by it
      had delighted Aunty Nan and the dwellers at the Gull Point Farm for a
      whole golden summer with carols at dawn and dusk about the old place!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know I&rsquo;m not very strong, Maria.&rdquo; said Aunty Nan pleadingly, &ldquo;but I
      am strong enough for that. Indeed I am. I could stay at Kensington over
      night with George&rsquo;s folks, you know, and so it wouldn&rsquo;t tire me much. I do
      so want to hear Joscelyn sing. Oh, how I love little Joscelyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It passes my understanding, the way you hanker after that child,&rdquo; cried
      Mrs. William impatiently. &ldquo;Why, she was a perfect stranger to you when she
      came here, and she was here only one summer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But oh, such a summer!&rdquo; said Aunty Nan softly. &ldquo;We all loved little
      Joscelyn. She just seemed like one of our own. She was one of God&rsquo;s
      children, carrying love with them everywhere. In some ways that little
      Anne Shirley the Cuthberts have got up there at Green Gables reminds me of
      her, though in other ways they&rsquo;re not a bit alike. Joscelyn was a beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that Shirley snippet certainly isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Mrs. William
      sarcastically. &ldquo;And if Joscelyn&rsquo;s tongue was one third as long as Anne
      Shirley&rsquo;s the wonder to me is that she didn&rsquo;t talk you all to death out of
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Joscelyn wasn&rsquo;t much of a talker,&rdquo; said Aunty Nan dreamily. &ldquo;She
      was kind of a quiet child. But you remember what she did say. And I&rsquo;ve
      never forgotten little Joscelyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. William shrugged her plump, shapely shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was fifteen years ago, Aunty Nan, and Joscelyn can&rsquo;t be very
      &lsquo;little&rsquo; now. She is a famous woman, and she has forgotten all about you,
      you can be sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joscelyn wasn&rsquo;t the kind that forgets,&rdquo; said Aunty Nan loyally. &ldquo;And,
      anyway, the point is, <i>I</i> haven&rsquo;t forgotten HER. Oh, Maria, I&rsquo;ve
      longed for years and years just to hear her sing once more. It seems as if
      I MUST hear my little Joscelyn sing once again before I die. I&rsquo;ve never
      had the chance before and I never will have it again. Do please ask
      William to take me to Kensington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Aunty Nan, this is really childish,&rdquo; said Mrs. William, whisking
      her bowlful of berries into the pantry. &ldquo;You must let other folks be the
      judge of what is best for you now. You aren&rsquo;t strong enough to drive to
      Kensington, and, even if you were, you know well enough that William
      couldn&rsquo;t go to Kensington to-morrow night. He has got to attend that
      political meeting at Newbridge. They can&rsquo;t do without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jordan could take me to Kensington,&rdquo; pleaded Aunty Nan, with very unusual
      persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! You couldn&rsquo;t go to Kensington with the hired man. Now, Aunty
      Nan, do be reasonable. Aren&rsquo;t William and I kind to you? Don&rsquo;t we do
      everything for your comfort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, oh, yes,&rdquo; admitted Aunty Nan deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you ought to be guided by our opinion. And you must just give
      up thinking about the Kensington concert, Aunty, and not worry yourself
      and me about it any more. I am going down to the shore field now to call
      William to tea. Just keep an eye on the baby in chance he wakes up, and
      see that the teapot doesn&rsquo;t boil over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. William whisked out of the kitchen, pretending not to see the tears
      that were falling over Aunty Nan&rsquo;s withered pink cheeks. Aunty Nan was
      really getting very childish, Mrs. William reflected, as she marched down
      to the shore field. Why, she cried now about every little thing! And such
      a notion&mdash;to want to go to the Old Timers&rsquo; concert at Kensington and
      be so set on it! Really, it was hard to put up with her whims. Mrs.
      William sighed virtuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Aunty Nan, she sat alone in the kitchen, and cried bitterly, as
      only lonely old age can cry. It seemed to her that she could not bear it,
      that she MUST go to Kensington. But she knew that it was not to be, since
      Mrs. William had decided otherwise. Mrs. William&rsquo;s word was law at Gull
      Point Farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with my old Aunty Nan?&rdquo; cried a hearty young voice from
      the doorway. Jordan Sloane stood there, his round, freckled face looking
      as anxious and sympathetic as it was possible for such a very round, very
      freckled face to look. Jordan was the Morrisons&rsquo; hired boy that summer,
      and he worshipped Aunty Nan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jordan,&rdquo; sobbed Aunty Nan, who was not above telling her troubles to
      the hired help, although Mrs. William thought she ought to be, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go
      to Kensington to-morrow night to hear little Joscelyn sing at the Old
      Timers&rsquo; concert. Maria says I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Jordan. &ldquo;Old cat,&rdquo; he muttered after the retreating
      and serenely unconscious Mrs. William. Then he shambled in and sat down on
      the sofa beside Aunty Nan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he said, patting her thin little shoulder with
      his big, sunburned paw. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make yourself sick if you go on crying,
      and we can&rsquo;t get along without you at Gull Point Farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunty Nan smiled wanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll soon have to get on without me, Jordan. I&rsquo;m not going
      to be here very long now. No, I&rsquo;m not, Jordan, I know it. Something tells
      me so very plainly. But I would be willing to go&mdash;glad to go, for I&rsquo;m
      very tired, Jordan&mdash;if I could only have heard little Joscelyn sing
      once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so set on hearing her?&rdquo; asked Jordan. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t no kin to
      you, is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but dearer to me&mdash;dearer to me than many of my own. Maria thinks
      that is silly, but you wouldn&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;d known her, Jordan. Even Maria
      herself wouldn&rsquo;t, if she had known her. It is fifteen years since she came
      here one summer to board. She was a child of thirteen then, and hadn&rsquo;t any
      relations except an old uncle who sent her to school in winter and boarded
      her out in summer, and didn&rsquo;t care a rap about her. The child was just
      starving for love, Jordan, and she got it here. William and his brothers
      were just children then, and they hadn&rsquo;t any sister. We all just
      worshipped her. She was so sweet, Jordan. And pretty, oh my! like a little
      girl in a picture, with great long curls, all black and purply and fine as
      spun silk, and big dark eyes, and such pink cheeks&mdash;real wild rose
      cheeks. And sing! My land! But couldn&rsquo;t she sing! Always singing, every
      hour of the day that voice was ringing round the old place. I used to hold
      my breath to hear it. She always said that she meant to be a famous singer
      some day, and I never doubted it a mite. It was born in her. Sunday
      evening she used to sing hymns for us. Oh, Jordan, it makes my old heart
      young again to remember it. A sweet child she was, my little Joscelyn! She
      used to write me for three or four years after she went away, but I
      haven&rsquo;t heard a word from her for long and long. I daresay she has
      forgotten me, as Maria says. &lsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be any wonder. But I haven&rsquo;t
      forgotten her, and oh, I want to see and hear her terrible much. She is to
      sing at the Old Timers&rsquo; concert to-morrow night at Kensington. The folks
      who are getting the concert up are friends of hers, or, of course, she&rsquo;d
      never have come to a little country village. Only sixteen miles away&mdash;and
      I can&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jordan couldn&rsquo;t think of anything to say. He reflected savagely that if he
      had a horse of his own he would take Aunty Nan to Kensington, Mrs. William
      or no Mrs. William. Though, to be sure, it WAS a long drive for her; and
      she was looking very frail this summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t going to last long,&rdquo; muttered Jordan, making his escape by the
      porch door as Mrs. William puffed in by the other. &ldquo;The sweetest old
      creetur that ever was created&rsquo;ll go when she goes. Yah, ye old madam, I&rsquo;d
      like to give you a piece of my mind, that I would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last was for Mrs. William, but was delivered in a prudent undertone.
      Jordan detested Mrs. William, but she was a power to be reckoned with, all
      the same. Meek, easy-going Billy Morrison did just what his wife told him
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Aunty Nan did not get to Kensington to hear little Joscelyn sing. She
      said nothing more about it but after that night she seemed to fail very
      rapidly. Mrs. William said it was the hot weather, and that Aunty Nan gave
      way too easily. But Aunty Nan could not help giving way now; she was very,
      very tired. Even her knitting wearied her. She would sit for hours in her
      rocking chair with the gray kitten in her lap, looking out of the window
      with dreamy, unseeing eyes. She talked to herself a good deal, generally
      about little Joscelyn. Mrs. William told Avonlea folk that Aunty Nan had
      got terribly childish and always accompanied the remark with a sigh that
      intimated how much she, Mrs. William, had to contend with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Justice must be done to Mrs. William, however. She was not unkind to Aunty
      Nan; on the contrary, she was very kind to her in the letter. Her comfort
      was scrupulously attended to, and Mrs. William had the grace to utter none
      of her complaints in the old woman&rsquo;s hearing. If Aunty Nan felt the
      absence of the spirit she never murmured at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when the Avonlea slopes were golden-hued with the ripened
      harvest, Aunty Nan did not get up. She complained of nothing but great
      weariness. Mrs. William remarked to her husband that if SHE lay in bed
      every day she felt tired, there wouldn&rsquo;t be much done at Gull Point Farm.
      But she prepared an excellent breakfast and carried it patiently up to
      Aunty Nan, who ate little of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Jordan crept up by way of the back stairs to see her. Aunty
      Nan was lying with her eyes fixed on the pale pink climbing roses that
      nodded about the window. When she saw Jordan she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them roses put me so much in mind of little Joscelyn,&rdquo; she said softly.
      &ldquo;She loved them so. If I could only see her! Oh, Jordan, if I could only
      see her! Maria says it&rsquo;s terrible childish to be always harping on that
      string, and mebbe it is. But&mdash;oh, Jordan, there&rsquo;s such a hunger in my
      heart for her, such a hunger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jordan felt a queer sensation in his throat, and twisted his ragged straw
      hat about in his big hands. Just then a vague idea which had hovered in
      his brain all day crystallized into decision. But all he said was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll feel better soon, Aunty Nan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Jordan dear, I&rsquo;ll be better soon,&rdquo; said Aunty Nan with her own
      sweet smile. &ldquo;&lsquo;The inhabitant shall not say I am sick,&rsquo; you know. But if I
      could only see little Joscelyn first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jordan went out and hurried down-stairs. Billy Morrison was in the stable,
      when Jordan stuck his head over the half-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, can I have the rest of the day off, sir? I want to go to
      Kensington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Billy Morrison amiably. &ldquo;May&rsquo;s well get you
      jaunting done &lsquo;fore harvest comes on. And here, Jord; take this quarter
      and get some oranges for Aunty Nan. Needn&rsquo;t mention it to headquarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy Morrison&rsquo;s face was solemn, but Jordan winked as he pocketed the
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve any luck, I&rsquo;ll bring her something that&rsquo;ll do her more good than
      the oranges,&rdquo; he muttered, as he hurried off to the pasture. Jordan had a
      horse of his own now, a rather bony nag, answering to the name of Dan.
      Billy Morrison had agreed to pasture the animal if Jordan used him in the
      farm work, an arrangement scoffed at by Mrs. William in no measured terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jordan hitched Dan into the second best buggy, dressed himself in his
      Sunday clothes, and drove off. On the road he re-read a paragraph he had
      clipped from the Charlottetown Daily Enterprise of the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joscelyn Burnett, the famous contralto, is spending a few days in
      Kensington on her return from her Maritime concert tour. She is the guest
      of Mr. and Mrs. Bromley, of The Beeches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now if I can get there in time,&rdquo; said Jordan emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jordan got to Kensington, put Dan up in a livery stable, and inquired the
      way to The Beeches. He felt rather nervous when he found it, it was such a
      stately, imposing place, set back from the street in an emerald green
      seclusion of beautiful grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy me stalking up to that front door and asking for Miss Joscelyn
      Burnett,&rdquo; grinned Jordan sheepishly. &ldquo;Mebbe they&rsquo;ll tell me to go around
      to the back and inquire for the cook. But you&rsquo;re going just the same,
      Jordan Sloane, and no skulking. March right up now. Think of Aunty Nan and
      don&rsquo;t let style down you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pert-looking maid answered Jordan&rsquo;s ring, and stared at him when he
      asked for Miss Burnett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can see her,&rdquo; she said shortly, scanning his country
      cut of hair and clothes rather superciliously. &ldquo;What is your business with
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid&rsquo;s scorn roused Jordan&rsquo;s &ldquo;dander,&rdquo; as he would have expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her that when I see her,&rdquo; he retorted coolly. &ldquo;Just you tell
      her that I&rsquo;ve a message for her from Aunty Nan Morrison of Gull Point
      Farm, Avonlea. If she hain&rsquo;t forgot, that&rsquo;ll fetch her. You might as well
      hurry up, if you please, I&rsquo;ve not overly too much time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pert maid decided to be civil at least, and invited Jordan to enter.
      But she left him standing in the hall while she went in search of Miss
      Burnett. Jordan gazed about him in amazement. He had never been in any
      place like this before. The hall was wonderful enough, and through the
      open doors on either hand stretched vistas of lovely rooms that, to
      Jordan&rsquo;s eyes, looked like those of a palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee whiz! How do they ever move around without knocking things over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Joscelyn Burnett came, and Jordan forgot everything else. This tall,
      beautiful woman, in her silken draperies, with a face like nothing Jordan
      had ever seen, or even dreamed about,&mdash;could this be Aunty Nan&rsquo;s
      little Joscelyn? Jordan&rsquo;s round, freckled countenance grew crimson. He
      felt horribly tonguetied and embarrassed. What could he say to her? How
      could he say it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Joscelyn Burnett looked at him with her large, dark eyes,&mdash;the eyes
      of a woman who had suffered much, and learned much, and won through
      struggle to victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come from Aunty Nan?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad to hear from
      her. Is she well? Come in here and tell me all about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned toward one of those fairy-like rooms, but Jordan interrupted
      her desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not in there, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;d never get it out. Just let me blunder
      through it out here someways. Yes&rsquo;m, Aunty Nan, she ain&rsquo;t very well. She&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      dying, I guess. And she&rsquo;s longing for you night and day. Seems as if she
      couldn&rsquo;t die in peace without seeing you. She wanted to get to Kensington
      to hear you sing, but that old cat of a Mrs. William&mdash;begging you
      pardon, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t let her come. She&rsquo;s always talking of you. If
      you can come out to Gull Point Farm and see her, I&rsquo;ll be most awful
      obliged to you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joscelyn Burnett looked troubled. She had not forgotten Gull Point Farm,
      nor Aunty Nan; but for years the memory had been dim, crowded into the
      background of consciousness by the more exciting events of her busy life.
      Now it came back with a rush. She recalled it all tenderly&mdash;the peace
      and beauty and love of that olden summer, and sweet Aunty Nan, so very
      wise in the lore of all things simple and good and true. For the moment
      Joscelyn Burnett was a lonely, hungry-hearted little girl again, seeking
      for love and finding it not, until Aunty Nan had taken her into her great
      mother-heart and taught her its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said perplexedly. &ldquo;If you had come sooner&mdash;I
      leave on the 11:30 train tonight. I MUST leave by then or I shall not
      reach Montreal in time to fill a very important engagement. And yet I must
      see Aunty Nan, too. I have been careless and neglectful. I might have gone
      to see her before. How can we manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you back to Kensington in time to catch that train,&rdquo; said
      Jordan eagerly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I wouldn&rsquo;t do for Aunty Nan&mdash;me and
      Dan. Yes, sir, you&rsquo;ll get back in time. Just think of Aunty Nan&rsquo;s face
      when she sees you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; said the great singer, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was sunset when they reached Gull Point Farm. An arc of warm gold was
      over the spruces behind the house. Mrs. William was out in the barn-yard,
      milking, and the house was deserted, save for the sleeping baby in the
      kitchen and the little old woman with the watchful eyes in the up-stairs
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Jordan, inwardly congratulating himself that the
      coast was clear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you right up to her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up-stairs, Joscelyn tapped at the half-open door and went in. Before it
      closed behind her, Jordan heard Aunty Nan say, &ldquo;Joscelyn! Little
      Joscelyn!&rdquo; in a tone that made him choke again. He stumbled thankfully
      down-stairs, to be pounced upon by Mrs. William in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jordan Sloane, who was that stylish woman you drove into the yard with?
      And what have you done with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Miss Joscelyn Burnett,&rdquo; said Jordan, expanding himself. This was
      his hour of triumph over Mrs. William. &ldquo;I went to Kensington and brung her
      out to see Aunty Nan. She&rsquo;s up with her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Mrs. William helplessly. &ldquo;And me in my milking rig!
      Jordan, for pity&rsquo;s sake, hold the baby while I go and put on my black
      silk. You might have given a body some warning. I declare I don&rsquo;t know
      which is the greatest idiot, you or Aunty Nan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. William flounced out of the kitchen, Jordan took his satisfaction
      in a quiet laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up-stairs in the little room was a great glory of sunset and gladness of
      human hearts. Joscelyn was kneeling by the bed, with her arms about Aunty
      Nan; and Aunty Nan, with her face all irradiated, was stroking Joscelyn&rsquo;s
      dark hair fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, little Joscelyn,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;it seems too good to be true. It
      seems like a beautiful dream. I knew you the minute you opened the door,
      my dearie. You haven&rsquo;t changed a bit. And you&rsquo;re a famous singer now,
      little Joscelyn! I always knew you would be. Oh, I want you to sing a
      piece for me&mdash;just one, won&rsquo;t you, dearie? Sing that piece people
      like to hear you sing best. I forget the name, but I&rsquo;ve read about it in
      the papers. Sing it for me, little Joscelyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Joscelyn, standing by Aunty Nan&rsquo;s bed, in the sunset light, sang the
      song she had sung to many a brilliant audience on many a noted
      concert-platform&mdash;sang it as even she had never sung before, while
      Aunty Nan lay and listened beatifically, and downstairs even Mrs. William
      held her breath, entranced by the exquisite melody that floated through
      the old farmhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, little Joscelyn!&rdquo; breathed Aunty Nan in rapture, when the song ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joscelyn knelt by her again and they had a long talk of old days. One by
      one they recalled the memories of that vanished summer. The past gave up
      its tears and its laughter. Heart and fancy alike went roaming through the
      ways of the long ago. Aunty Nan was perfectly happy. And then Joscelyn
      told her all the story of her struggles and triumphs since they had
      parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the moonlight began to creep in through the low window, Aunty Nan put
      out her hand and touched Joscelyn&rsquo;s bowed head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Joscelyn,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t asking too much, I want you
      to sing just one other piece. Do you remember when you were here how we
      sung hymns in the parlour every Sunday night, and my favourite always was
      &lsquo;The Sands of Time are Sinking?&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t never forgot how you used to sing
      that, and I want to hear it just once again, dearie. Sing it for me,
      little Joscelyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joscelyn rose and went to the window. Lifting back the curtain, she stood
      in the splendour of the moonlight, and sang the grand old hymn. At first
      Aunty Nan beat time to it feebly on the counterpane; but when Joscelyn
      came to the verse, &ldquo;With mercy and with judgment,&rdquo; she folded her hands
      over her breast and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hymn ended, Joscelyn came over to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I must say good-bye now, Aunty Nan,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she saw that Aunty Nan had fallen asleep. She would not waken her,
      but she took from her breast the cluster of crimson roses she wore and
      slipped them gently between the toil-worn fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dear, sweet mother-heart,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down-stairs she met Mrs. William splendid in rustling black silk, her
      broad, rubicund face smiling, overflowing with apologies and welcomes,
      which Joscelyn cut short coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Morrison, but I cannot possibly stay longer. No, thank
      you, I don&rsquo;t care for any refreshments. Jordan is going to take me back to
      Kensington at once. I came out to see Aunty Nan.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain she&rsquo;d be
      delighted,&rdquo; said Mrs. William effusively. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been talking about you
      for weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it has made her very happy,&rdquo; said Joscelyn gravely. &ldquo;And it has made
      me happy, too. I love Aunty Nan, Mrs. Morrison, and I owe her much. In all
      my life I have never met a woman so purely, unselfishly good and noble and
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy now,&rdquo; said Mrs. William, rather overcome at hearing this great
      singer pronounce such an encomium on quiet, timid old Aunty Nan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jordan drove Joscelyn back to Kensington; and up-stairs in her room Aunty
      Nan slept, with that rapt smile on her face and Joscelyn&rsquo;s red roses in
      her hands. Thus it was that Mrs. William found her, going in the next
      morning with her breakfast. The sunlight crept over the pillow, lighting
      up the sweet old face and silver hair, and stealing downward to the faded
      red roses on her breast. Smiling and peaceful and happy lay Aunty Nan, for
      she had fallen on the sleep that knows no earthy wakening, while little
      Joscelyn sang.

    <h2>
      V. The Winning of Lucinda
    </h2>
    <p>
      The marriage of a Penhallow was always the signal for a gathering of the
      Penhallows. From the uttermost parts of the earth they would come&mdash;Penhallows
      by birth, and Penhallows by marriage and Penhallows by ancestry. East
      Grafton was the ancient habitat of the race, and Penhallow Grange, where
      &ldquo;old&rdquo; John Penhallow lived, was a Mecca to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the family itself, the exact kinship of all its various branches
      and ramifications was a hard thing to define. Old Uncle Julius Penhallow
      was looked upon as a veritable wonder because he carried it all in his
      head and could tell on sight just what relation any one Penhallow was to
      any other Penhallow. The rest made a blind guess at it, for the most part,
      and the younger Penhallows let it go at loose cousinship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this instance it was Alice Penhallow, daughter of &ldquo;young&rdquo; John
      Penhallow, who was to be married. Alice was a nice girl, but she and her
      wedding only pertain to this story in so far as they furnish a background
      for Lucinda; hence nothing more need be said of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of her wedding day&mdash;the Penhallows held to the good,
      old-fashioned custom of evening weddings with a rousing dance afterwards&mdash;Penhallow
      Grange was filled to overflowing with guests who had come there to have
      tea and rest themselves before going down to &ldquo;young&rdquo; John&rsquo;s. Many of them
      had driven fifty miles. In the big autumnal orchard the younger fry
      foregathered and chatted and coquetted. Up-stairs, in &ldquo;old&rdquo; Mrs. John&rsquo;s
      bedroom, she and her married daughters held high conclave. &ldquo;Old&rdquo; John had
      established himself with his sons and sons-in-law in the parlour, and the
      three daughters-in-law were making themselves at home in the blue
      sitting-room, ear-deep in harmless family gossip. Lucinda and Romney
      Penhallow were also there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thin Mrs. Nathaniel Penhallow sat in a rocking chair and toasted her toes
      at the grate, for the brilliant autumn afternoon was slightly chilly and
      Lucinda, as usual, had the window open. She and plump Mrs. Frederick
      Penhallow did most of the talking. Mrs. George Penhallow being rather out
      of it by reason of her newness. She was George Penhallow&rsquo;s second wife,
      married only a year. Hence, her contributions to the conversation were
      rather spasmodic, hurled in, as it were, by dead reckoning, being
      sometimes appropriate and sometimes savouring of a point of view not
      strictly Penhallowesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romney Penhallow was sitting in a corner, listening to the chatter of the
      women, with the inscrutable smile that always vexed Mrs. Frederick. Mrs.
      George wondered within herself what he did there among the women. She also
      wondered just where he belonged on the family tree. He was not one of the
      uncles, yet he could not be much younger than George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty, if he is a day,&rdquo; was Mrs. George&rsquo;s mental dictum, &ldquo;but a very
      handsome and fascinating man. I never saw such a splendid chin and
      dimple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda, with bronze-colored hair and the whitest of skins, defiant of
      merciless sunlight and revelling in the crisp air, sat on the sill of the
      open window behind the crimson vine leaves, looking out into the garden,
      where dahlias flamed and asters broke into waves of purple and snow. The
      ruddy light of the autumn afternoon gave a sheen to the waves of her hair
      and brought out the exceeding purity of her Greek outlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. George knew who Lucinda was&mdash;a cousin of the second generation,
      and, in spite of her thirty-five years, the acknowledged beauty of the
      whole Penhallow connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was one of those rare women who keep their loveliness unmarred by the
      passage of years. She had ripened and matured, but she had not grown old.
      The older Penhallows were still inclined, from sheer force of habit, to
      look upon her as a girl, and the younger Penhallows hailed her as one of
      themselves. Yet Lucinda never aped girlishness; good taste and a strong
      sense of humour preserved her amid many temptations thereto. She was
      simply a beautiful, fully developed woman, with whom Time had declared a
      truce, young with a mellow youth which had nothing to do with years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. George liked and admired Lucinda. Now, when Mrs. George liked and
      admired any person, it was a matter of necessity with her to impart her
      opinions to the most convenient confidant. In this case it was Romney
      Penhallow to whom Mrs. George remarked sweetly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, don&rsquo;t you think our Lucinda is looking remarkably well this
      fall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a very harmless, inane, well-meant question. Poor Mrs. George
      might well be excused for feeling bewildered over the effect. Romney
      gathered his long legs together, stood up, and swept the unfortunate
      speaker a crushing Penhallow bow of state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far be it from me to disagree with the opinion of a lady&mdash;especially
      when it concerns another lady,&rdquo; he said, as he left the blue room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overcome by the mordant satire in his tone, Mrs. George glanced
      speechlessly at Lucinda. Behold, Lucinda had squarely turned her back on
      the party and was gazing out into the garden, with a very decided flush on
      the snowy curves of her neck and cheek. Then Mrs. George looked at her
      sisters-in-law. They were regarding her with the tolerant amusement they
      might bestow on a blundering child. Mrs. George experienced that subtle
      prescience whereby it is given us to know that we have put our foot in it.
      She felt herself turning an uncomfortable brick-red. What Penhallow
      skeleton had she unwittingly jangled? Why, oh, why, was it such an evident
      breach of the proprieties to praise Lucinda?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. George was devoutly thankful that a summons to the tea-table rescued
      her from her mire of embarrassment. The meal was spoiled for her, however;
      the mortifying recollection of her mysterious blunder conspired with her
      curiosity to banish appetite. As soon as possible after tea she decoyed
      Mrs. Frederick out into the garden and in the dahlia walk solemnly
      demanded the reason of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frederick indulged in a laugh which put the mettle of her festal
      brown silk seams to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cecilia, it was SO amusing,&rdquo; she said, a little patronizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But WHY!&rdquo; cried Mrs. George, resenting the patronage and the mystery.
      &ldquo;What was so dreadful in what I said? Or so funny? And WHO is this Romney
      Penhallow who mustn&rsquo;t be spoken to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Romney is one of the Charlottetown Penhallows,&rdquo; explained Mrs.
      Frederick. &ldquo;He is a lawyer there. He is a first cousin of Lucinda&rsquo;s and a
      second of George&rsquo;s&mdash;or is he? Oh, bother! You must go to Uncle John
      if you want the genealogy. I&rsquo;m in a chronic muddle concerning Penhallow
      relationship. And, as for Romney, of course you can speak to him about
      anything you like except Lucinda. Oh, you innocent! To ask him if he
      didn&rsquo;t think Lucinda was looking well! And right before her, too! Of
      course he thought you did it on purpose to tease him. That was what made
      him so savage and sarcastic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But WHY?&rdquo; persisted Mrs. George, sticking tenaciously to her point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t George told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said George&rsquo;s wife in mild exasperation. &ldquo;George has spent most of
      his time since we were married telling me odd things about the Penhallows,
      but he hasn&rsquo;t got to that yet, evidently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear, it is our family romance. Lucinda and Romney are in love
      with each other. They have been in love with each other for fifteen years
      and in all that time they have never spoken to each other once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. George, feeling the inadequacy of mere language.
      Was this a Penhallow method of courtship? &ldquo;But WHY?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had a quarrel fifteen years ago,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frederick patiently.
      &ldquo;Nobody knows how it originated or anything about it except that Lucinda
      herself admitted it to us afterwards. But, in the first flush of her rage,
      she told Romney that she would never speak to him again as long as she
      lived. And HE said he would never speak to her until she spoke first&mdash;because,
      you see, as she was in the wrong she ought to make the first advance. And
      they never have spoken. Everybody in the connection, I suppose, has taken
      turns trying to reconcile them, but nobody has succeeded. I don&rsquo;t believe
      that Romney has ever so much as THOUGHT of any other woman in his whole
      life, and certainly Lucinda has never thought of any other man. You will
      notice she still wears Romney&rsquo;s ring. They&rsquo;re practically engaged still,
      of course. And Romney said once that if Lucinda would just say one word,
      no matter what it was, even if it were something insulting, he would
      speak, too, and beg her pardon for his share in the quarrel&mdash;because
      then, you see, he would not be breaking his word. He hasn&rsquo;t referred to
      the matter for years, but I presume that he is of the same mind still. And
      they are just as much in love with each other as they ever were. He&rsquo;s
      always hanging about where she is&mdash;when other people are there, too,
      that is. He avoids her like a plague when she is alone. That was why he
      was stuck out in the blue room with us to-day. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a
      particle of resentment between them. If Lucinda would only speak! But that
      Lucinda will not do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think she will yet?&rdquo; said Mrs. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frederick shook her crimped head sagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now. The whole thing has hardened too long. Her pride will never let
      her speak. We used to hope she would be tricked into it by forgetfulness
      or accident&mdash;we used to lay traps for her&mdash;but all to no effect.
      It is such a shame, too. They were made for each other. Do you know, I get
      cross when I begin to thrash the whole silly affair over like this.
      Doesn&rsquo;t it sound as if we were talking of the quarrel of two
      school-children? Of late years we have learned that it does not do to
      speak of Lucinda to Romney, even in the most commonplace way. He seems to
      resent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HE ought to speak,&rdquo; cried Mrs. George warmly. &ldquo;Even if she were in the
      wrong ten times over, he ought to overlook it and speak first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t. And she won&rsquo;t. You never saw two such determined mortals.
      They get it from their grandfather on the mother&rsquo;s side&mdash;old Absalom
      Gordon. There is no such stubbornness on the Penhallow side. His obstinacy
      was a proverb, my dear&mdash;actually a proverb. What ever he said, he
      would stick to if the skies fell. He was a terrible old man to swear,
      too,&rdquo; added Mrs. Frederick, dropping into irrelevant reminiscence. &ldquo;He
      spent a long while in a mining camp in his younger days and he never got
      over it&mdash;the habit of swearing, I mean. It would have made your blood
      run cold, my dear, to have heard him go on at times. And yet he was a real
      good old man every other way. He couldn&rsquo;t help it someway. He tried to,
      but he used to say that profanity came as natural to him as breathing. It
      used to mortify his family terribly. Fortunately, none of them took after
      him in that respect. But he&rsquo;s dead&mdash;and one shouldn&rsquo;t speak ill of
      the dead. I must go and get Mattie Penhallow to do my hair. I would burst
      these sleeves clean out if I tried to do it myself and I don&rsquo;t want to
      dress over again. You won&rsquo;t be likely to talk to Romney about Lucinda
      again, my dear Cecilia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen years!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. George helplessly to the dahlias. &ldquo;Engaged
      for fifteen years and never speaking to each other! Dear heart and soul,
      think of it! Oh, these Penhallows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Lucinda, serenely unconscious that her love story was being
      mouthed over by Mrs. Frederick in the dahlia garden, was dressing for the
      wedding. Lucinda still enjoyed dressing for a festivity, since the mirror
      still dealt gently with her. Moreover, she had a new dress. Now, a new
      dress&mdash;and especially one as nice as this&mdash;was a rarity with
      Lucinda, who belonged to a branch of the Penhallows noted for being
      chronically hard up. Indeed, Lucinda and her widowed mother were
      positively poor, and hence a new dress was an event in Lucinda&rsquo;s
      existence. An uncle had given her this one&mdash;a beautiful, perishable
      thing, such as Lucinda would never have dared to choose for herself, but
      in which she revelled with feminine delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of pale green voile&mdash;a colour which brought out admirably the
      ruddy gloss of her hair and the clear brilliance of her skin. When she had
      finished dressing she looked at herself in the mirror with frank delight.
      Lucinda was not vain, but she was quite well aware of the fact of her
      beauty and took an impersonal pleasure in it, as if she were looking at
      some finely painted picture by a master hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The form and face reflected in the glass satisfied her. The puffs and
      draperies of the green voile displayed to perfection the full, but not
      over-full, curves of her fine figure. Lucinda lifted her arm and touched a
      red rose to her lips with the hand upon which shone the frosty glitter of
      Romney&rsquo;s diamond, looking at the graceful slope of her shoulder and the
      splendid line of chin and throat with critical approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      She noted, too, how well the gown became her eyes, bringing out all the
      deeper colour in them. Lucinda had magnificent eyes. Once Romney had
      written a sonnet to them in which he compared their colour to ripe
      blueberries. This may not sound poetical to you unless you know or
      remember just what the tints of ripe blueberries are&mdash;dusky purple in
      some lights, clear slate in others, and yet again in others the misty hue
      of early meadow violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really look very well,&rdquo; remarked the real Lucinda to the mirrored
      Lucinda. &ldquo;Nobody would think you were an old maid. But you are. Alice
      Penhallow, who is to be married to-night, was a child of five when you
      thought of being married fifteen years ago. That makes you an old maid, my
      dear. Well, it is your own fault, and it will continue to be your own
      fault, you stubborn offshoot of a stubborn breed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung her train out straight and pulled on her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope I won&rsquo;t get any spots on this dress to-night,&rdquo; she reflected.
      &ldquo;It will have to do me for a gala dress for a year at least&mdash;and I
      have a creepy conviction that it is fearfully spottable. Bless Uncle
      Mark&rsquo;s good, uncalculating heart! How I would have detested it if he had
      given me something sensible and useful and ugly&mdash;as Aunt Emilia would
      have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all went to &ldquo;young&rdquo; John Penhallow&rsquo;s at early moonrise. Lucinda drove
      over the two miles of hill and dale with a youthful second cousin, by
      name, Carey Penhallow. The wedding was quite a brilliant affair. Lucinda
      seemed to pervade the social atmosphere, and everywhere she went a little
      ripple of admiration trailed after her like a wave. She was undeniably a
      belle, yet she found herself feeling faintly bored and was rather glad
      than otherwise when the guests began to fray off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m losing my capacity for enjoyment,&rdquo; she thought, a little
      drearily. &ldquo;Yes, I must be growing old. That is what it means when social
      functions begin to bore you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was that unlucky Mrs. George who blundered again. She was standing on
      the veranda when Carey Penhallow dashed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Lucinda that I can&rsquo;t take her back to the Grange. I have to drive
      Mark and Cissy Penhallow to Bright River to catch the two o&rsquo;clock express.
      There will be plenty of chances for her with the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment George Penhallow, holding his rearing horse with
      difficulty, shouted for his wife. Mrs. George, all in a flurry, dashed
      back into the still crowded hall. Exactly to whom she gave her message was
      never known to any of the Penhallows. But a tall, ruddy-haired girl,
      dressed in pale green organdy&mdash;Anne Shirley from Avonlea&mdash;told
      Marilla Cuthbert and Rachel Lynde as a joke the next morning how a chubby
      little woman in a bright pink fascinator had clutched her by the arm, and
      gasped out: &ldquo;Carey Penhallow can&rsquo;t take you&mdash;he says you&rsquo;re to look
      out for someone else,&rdquo; and was gone before she could answer or turn
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that Lucinda, when she came out to the veranda step, found
      herself unaccountably deserted. All the Grange Penhallows were gone;
      Lucinda realized this after a few moments of bewildered seeking, and she
      understood that if she were to get to the Grange that night she must walk.
      Plainly there was nobody to take her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda was angry. It is not pleasant to find yourself forgotten and
      neglected. It is still less pleasant to walk home alone along a country
      road, at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, wearing a pale green voile. Lucinda
      was not prepared for such a walk. She had nothing on her feet save
      thin-soled shoes, and her only wraps were a flimsy fascinator and a short
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a guy I shall look, stalking home alone in this rig,&rdquo; she thought
      crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it, unless she confessed her plight to some of the
      stranger guests and begged a drive home. Lucinda&rsquo;s pride scorned such a
      request and the admission of neglect it involved. No, she would walk,
      since that was all there was to it; but she would not go by the main road
      to be stared at by all and sundry who might pass her. There was a short
      cut by way of a lane across the fields; she knew every inch of it,
      although she had not traversed it for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gathered up the green voile as trimly as possible, slipped around the
      house in the kindly shadows, picked her way across the side lawn, and
      found a gate which opened into a birch-bordered lane where the frosted
      trees shone with silvery-golden radiance in the moonlight. Lucinda flitted
      down the lane, growing angrier at every step as the realization of how
      shamefully she seemed to have been treated came home to her. She believed
      that nobody had thought about her at all, which was tenfold worse than
      premeditated neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she came to the gate at the lower end of the lane a man who was leaning
      over it started, with a quick intake of his breath, which, in any other
      man than Romney Penhallow, or for any other woman than Lucinda Penhallow,
      would have been an exclamation of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda recognized him with a great deal of annoyance and a little relief.
      She would not have to walk home alone. But with Romney Penhallow! Would he
      think she had contrived it so purposely?
    </p>
    <p>
      Romney silently opened the gate for her, silently latched it behind her,
      and silently fell into step beside her. Down across a velvety sweep of
      field they went; the air was frosty, calm and still; over the world lay a
      haze of moonshine and mist that converted East Grafton&rsquo;s prosaic hills and
      fields into a shimmering fairyland. At first Lucinda felt angrier than
      ever. What a ridiculous situation! How the Penhallows would laugh over it!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Romney, he, too, was angry with the trick impish chance had played
      him. He liked being the butt of an awkward situation as little as most
      men; and certainly to be obliged to walk home over moonlit fields at one
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning with the woman he had loved and never spoken to for
      fifteen years was the irony of fate with a vengeance. Would she think he
      had schemed for it? And how the deuce did she come to be walking home from
      the wedding at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they had crossed the field and reached the wild cherry lane
      beyond it, Lucinda&rsquo;s anger was mastered by her saving sense of humour. She
      was even smiling a little maliciously under her fascinator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lane was a place of enchantment&mdash;a long, moonlit colonnade adown
      which beguiling wood nymphs might have footed it featly. The moonshine
      fell through the arching boughs and made a mosaic of silver light and
      clear-cut shadow for the unfriendly lovers to walk in. On either side was
      the hovering gloom of the woods, and around them was a great silence
      unstirred by wind or murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midway in the lane Lucinda was attacked by a sentimental recollection. She
      thought of the last time Romney and she had walked home together through
      this very lane, from a party at &ldquo;young&rdquo; John&rsquo;s. It had been moonlight then
      too, and&mdash;Lucinda checked a sigh&mdash;they had walked hand in hand.
      Just here, by the big gray beech, he had stopped her and kissed her.
      Lucinda wondered if he were thinking of it, too, and stole a look at him
      from under the lace border of her fascinator.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was striding moodily along with his hands in his pockets, and his
      hat pulled down over his eyes, passing the old beech without a glance at
      it. Lucinda checked another sigh, gathered up an escaped flutter of voile,
      and marched on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Past the lane a range of three silvery harvest fields sloped down to Peter
      Penhallow&rsquo;s brook&mdash;a wide, shallow stream bridged over in the olden
      days by the mossy trunk of an ancient fallen tree. When Lucinda and Romney
      arrived at the brook they gazed at the brawling water blankly. Lucinda
      remembered that she must not speak to Romney just in time to prevent an
      exclamation of dismay. There was no tree! There was no bridge of any kind
      over the brook!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a predicament! But before Lucinda could do more than despairingly
      ask herself what was to be done now, Romney answered&mdash;not in words,
      but in deeds. He coolly picked Lucinda up in his arms, as if she had been
      a child instead of a full grown woman of no mean avoirdupois, and began to
      wade with her through the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda gasped helplessly. She could not forbid him and she was so choked
      with rage over his presumption that she could not have spoken in any case.
      Then came the catastrophe. Romney&rsquo;s foot slipped on a treacherous round
      stone&mdash;there was a tremendous splash&mdash;and Romney and Lucinda
      Penhallow were sitting down in the middle of Peter Penhallow&rsquo;s brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda was the first to regain her feet. About her clung in
      heart-breaking limpness the ruined voile. The remembrance of all her
      wrongs that night rushed over her soul, and her eyes blazed in the
      moonlight. Lucinda Penhallow had never been so angry in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU D&mdash;D IDIOT!&rdquo; she said, in a voice that literally shook with
      rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romney meekly scrambled up the bank after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Lucinda,&rdquo; he said, striving with uncertain success to
      keep a suspicious quiver of laughter out of his tone. &ldquo;It was wretchedly
      clumsy of me, but that pebble turned right under my foot. Please forgive
      me&mdash;for that&mdash;and for other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda deigned no answer. She stood on a flat stone and wrung the water
      from the poor green voile. Romney surveyed her apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry, Lucinda,&rdquo; he entreated. &ldquo;You will catch your death of cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never take cold,&rdquo; answered Lucinda, with chattering teeth. &ldquo;And it is
      my dress I am thinking of&mdash;was thinking of. You have more need to
      hurry. You are sopping wet yourself and you know you are subject to colds.
      There&mdash;come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucinda picked up the stringy train, which had been so brave and buoyant
      five minutes before, and started up the field at a brisk rate. Romney came
      up to her and slipped his arm through hers in the old way. For a time they
      walked along in silence. Then Lucinda began to shake with inward laughter.
      She laughed silently for the whole length of the field; and at the line
      fence between Peter Penhallow&rsquo;s land and the Grange acres she paused,
      threw back the fascinator from her face, and looked at Romney defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thinking of&mdash;THAT,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and I am thinking of it. And
      we will go on, thinking of it at intervals for the rest of our lives. But
      if you ever mention it to me I&rsquo;ll never forgive you, Romney Penhallow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never will,&rdquo; Romney promised. There was more than a suspicion of
      laughter in his voice this time, but Lucinda did not choose to resent it.
      She did not speak again until they reached the Grange gate. Then she faced
      him solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a case of atavism,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Old Grandfather Gordon was to blame
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the Grange almost everybody was in bed. What with the guests straggling
      home at intervals and hurrying sleepily off to their rooms, nobody had
      missed Lucinda, each set supposing she was with some other set. Mrs.
      Frederick, Mrs. Nathaniel and Mrs. George alone were up. The perennially
      chilly Mrs. Nathaniel had kindled a fire of chips in the blue room grate
      to warm her feet before retiring, and the three women were discussing the
      wedding in subdued tones when the door opened and the stately form of
      Lucinda, stately even in the dragged voile, appeared, with the damp Romney
      behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucinda Penhallow!&rdquo; gasped they, one and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was left to walk home,&rdquo; said Lucinda coolly. &ldquo;So Romney and I came
      across the fields. There was no bridge over the brook, and when he was
      carrying me over he slipped and we fell in. That is all. No, Cecilia, I
      never take cold, so don&rsquo;t worry. Yes, my dress is ruined, but that is of
      no consequence. No, thank you, Cecilia, I do not care for a hot drink.
      Romney, do go and take off those wet clothes of yours immediately. No,
      Cecilia, I will NOT take a hot footbath. I am going straight to bed. Good
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the door closed on the pair the three sisters-in-law stared at each
      other. Mrs. Frederick, feeling herself incapable of expressing her
      sensations originally, took refuge in a quotation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do I sleep, do I dream, do I wonder and doubt? Is things what they seem,
      or is visions about?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be another Penhallow wedding soon,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nathaniel, with
      a long breath. &ldquo;Lucinda has spoken to Romney AT LAST.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, WHAT do you suppose she said to him?&rdquo; cried Mrs. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cecilia,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frederick, &ldquo;we shall never know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They never did know.

      VI. Old Man Shaw&rsquo;s Girl
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day after to-morrow&mdash;day after to-morrow,&rdquo; said Old Man Shaw,
      rubbing his long slender hands together gleefully. &ldquo;I have to keep saying
      it over and over, so as to really believe it. It seems far too good to be
      true that I&rsquo;m to have Blossom again. And everything is ready. Yes, I think
      everything is ready, except a bit of cooking. And won&rsquo;t this orchard be a
      surprise to her! I&rsquo;m just going to bring her out here as soon as I can,
      never saying a word. I&rsquo;ll fetch her through the spruce lane, and when we
      come to the end of the path I&rsquo;ll step back casual-like, and let her go out
      from under the trees alone, never suspecting. It&rsquo;ll be worth ten times the
      trouble to see her big, brown eyes open wide and hear her say, &lsquo;Oh, daddy!
      Why, daddy!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his hands again and laughed softly to himself. He was a tall,
      bent old man, whose hair was snow white, but whose face was fresh and
      rosy. His eyes were a boy&rsquo;s eyes, large, blue and merry, and his mouth had
      never got over a youthful trick of smiling at any provocation&mdash;and,
      oft-times, at no provocation at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, White Sands people would not have given you the most
      favourable opinion in the world of Old Man Shaw. First and foremost, they
      would have told you that he was &ldquo;shiftless,&rdquo; and had let his bit of a farm
      run out while he pottered with flowers and bugs, or rambled aimlessly
      about in the woods, or read books along the shore. Perhaps it was true;
      but the old farm yielded him a living, and further than that Old Man Shaw
      had no ambition. He was as blithe as a pilgrim on a pathway climbing to
      the west. He had learned the rare secret that you must take happiness when
      you find it&mdash;that there is no use in marking the place and coming
      back to it at a more convenient season, because it will not be there then.
      And it is very easy to be happy if you know, as Old Man Shaw most
      thoroughly knew, how to find pleasure in little things. He enjoyed life,
      he had always enjoyed life and helped others to enjoy it; consequently his
      life was a success, whatever White Sands people might think of it. What if
      he had not &ldquo;improved&rdquo; his farm? There are some people to whom life will
      never be anything more than a kitchen garden; and there are others to whom
      it will always be a royal palace with domes and minarets of rainbow fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orchard of which he was so proud was as yet little more than the
      substance of things hoped for&mdash;a flourishing plantation of young
      trees which would amount to something later on. Old Man Shaw&rsquo;s house was
      on the crest of a bare, sunny hill, with a few staunch old firs and
      spruces behind it&mdash;the only trees that could resist the full sweep of
      the winds that blew bitterly up from the sea at times. Fruit trees would
      never grow near it, and this had been a great grief to Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, daddy, if we could just have an orchard!&rdquo; she had been wont to say
      wistfully, when other farmhouses in White Sands were smothered whitely in
      apple bloom. And when she had gone away, and her father had nothing to
      look forward to save her return, he was determined she should find an
      orchard when she came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the southward hill, warmly sheltered by spruce woods and sloping to
      the sunshine, was a little field, so fertile that all the slack management
      of a life-time had not availed to exhaust it. Here Old Man Shaw set out
      his orchard and saw it flourish, watching and tending it until he came to
      know each tree as a child and loved it. His neighbours laughed at him, and
      said that the fruit of an orchard so far away from the house would all be
      stolen. But as yet there was no fruit, and when the time came for bearing
      there would be enough and to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blossom and me&rsquo;ll get all we want, and the boys can have the rest, if
      they want &lsquo;em worse&rsquo;n they want a good conscience,&rdquo; said that unworldly,
      unbusinesslike Old Man Shaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way back home from his darling orchard he found a rare fern in the
      woods and dug it up for Sara&mdash;she had loved ferns. He planted it at
      the shady, sheltered side of the house and then sat down on the old bench
      by the garden gate to read her last letter&mdash;the letter that was only
      a note, because she was coming home soon. He knew every word of it by
      heart, but that did not spoil the pleasure of re-reading it every
      half-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Shaw had not married until late in life, and had, so White Sands
      people said, selected a wife with his usual judgment&mdash;which, being
      interpreted, meant no judgment at all; otherwise, he would never have
      married Sara Glover, a mere slip of a girl, with big brown eyes like a
      frightened wood creature&rsquo;s, and the delicate, fleeting bloom of a spring
      Mayflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last woman in the world for a farmer&rsquo;s wife&mdash;no strength or
      get-up about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither could White Sands folk understand what on earth Sara Glover had
      married him for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the fool crop was the only one that never failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Shaw&mdash;he was Old Man Shaw even then, although he was only
      forty&mdash;and his girl bride had troubled themselves not at all about
      White Sands opinions. They had one year of perfect happiness, which is
      always worth living for, even if the rest of life be a dreary pilgrimage,
      and then Old Man Shaw found himself alone again, except for little
      Blossom. She was christened Sara, after her dead mother, but she was
      always Blossom to her father&mdash;the precious little blossom whose
      plucking had cost the mother her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara Glover&rsquo;s people, especially a wealthy aunt in Montreal, had wanted to
      take the child, but Old Man Shaw grew almost fierce over the suggestion.
      He would give his baby to no one. A woman was hired to look after the
      house, but it was the father who cared for the baby in the main. He was as
      tender and faithful and deft as a woman. Sara never missed a mother&rsquo;s
      care, and she grew up into a creature of life and light and beauty, a
      constant delight to all who knew her. She had a way of embroidering life
      with stars. She was dowered with all the charming characteristics of both
      parents, with a resilient vitality and activity which had pertained to
      neither of them. When she was ten years old she had packed all hirelings
      off, and kept house for her father for six delightful years&mdash;years in
      which they were father and daughter, brother and sister, and &ldquo;chums.&rdquo; Sara
      never went to school, but her father saw to her education after a fashion
      of his own. When their work was done they lived in the woods and fields,
      in the little garden they had made on the sheltered side of the house, or
      on the shore, where sunshine and storm were to them equally lovely and
      beloved. Never was comradeship more perfect or more wholly satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just wrapped up in each other,&rdquo; said White Sands folk, half-enviously,
      half-disapprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sara was sixteen Mrs. Adair, the wealthy aunt aforesaid, pounced down
      on White Sands in a glamour of fashion and culture and outer worldliness.
      She bombarded Old Man Shaw with such arguments that he had to succumb. It
      was a shame that a girl like Sara should grow up in a place like White
      Sands, &ldquo;with no advantages and no education,&rdquo; said Mrs. Adair scornfully,
      not understanding that wisdom and knowledge are two entirely different
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least let me give my dear sister&rsquo;s child what I would have given my
      own daughter if I had had one,&rdquo; she pleaded tearfully. &ldquo;Let me take her
      with me and send her to a good school for a few years. Then, if she
      wishes, she may come back to you, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Privately, Mrs. Adair did not for a moment believe that Sara would want to
      come back to White Sands, and her queer old father, after three years of
      the life she would give her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Shaw yielded, influenced thereto not at all by Mrs. Adair&rsquo;s
      readily flowing tears, but greatly by his conviction that justice to Sara
      demanded it. Sara herself did not want to go; she protested and pleaded;
      but her father, having become convinced that it was best for her to go,
      was inexorable. Everything, even her own feelings, must give way to that.
      But she was to come back to him without let or hindrance when her
      &ldquo;schooling&rdquo; was done. It was only on having this most clearly understood
      that Sara would consent to go at all. Her last words, called back to her
      father through her tears as she and her aunt drove down the lane, were,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back, daddy. In three years I&rsquo;ll be back. Don&rsquo;t cry, but just
      look forward to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had looked forward to it through the three long, lonely years that
      followed, in all of which he never saw his darling. Half a continent was
      between them and Mrs. Adair had vetoed vacation visits, under some
      specious pretense. But every week brought its letter from Sara. Old Man
      Shaw had every one of them, tied up with one of her old blue hair ribbons,
      and kept in her mother&rsquo;s little rose-wood work-box in the parlour. He
      spent every Sunday afternoon re-reading them, with her photograph before
      him. He lived alone, refusing to be pestered with kind help, but he kept
      the house in beautiful order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A better housekeeper than farmer,&rdquo; said White Sands people. He would have
      nothing altered. When Sara came back she was not to be hurt by changes. It
      never occurred to him that she might be changed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now those three interminable years were gone, and Sara was coming
      home. She wrote him nothing of her aunt&rsquo;s pleadings and reproaches and
      ready, futile tears; she wrote only that she would graduate in June and
      start for home a week later. Thenceforth Old Man Shaw went about in a
      state of beatitude, making ready for her homecoming. As he sat on the
      bench in the sunshine, with the blue sea sparkling and crinkling down at
      the foot of the green slope, he reflected with satisfaction that all was
      in perfect order. There was nothing left to do save count the hours until
      that beautiful, longed-for day after to-morrow. He gave himself over to a
      reverie, as sweet as a day-dream in a haunted valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red roses were out in bloom. Sara had always loved those red roses&mdash;they
      were as vivid as herself, with all her own fullness of life and joy of
      living. And, besides these, a miracle had happened in Old Man Shaw&rsquo;s
      garden. In one corner was a rose-bush which had never bloomed, despite all
      the coaxing they had given it&mdash;&ldquo;the sulky rose-bush,&rdquo; Sara had been
      wont to call it. Lo! this summer had flung the hoarded sweetness of years
      into plentiful white blossoms, like shallow ivory cups with a haunting,
      spicy fragrance. It was in honour of Sara&rsquo;s home-coming&mdash;so Old Man
      Shaw liked to fancy. All things, even the sulky rose-bush, knew she was
      coming back, and were making glad because of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gloating over Sara&rsquo;s letter when Mrs. Peter Blewett came. She told
      him she had run up to see how he was getting on, and if he wanted anything
      seen to before Sara came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo;m, thank you, ma&rsquo;am. Everything is attended to. I couldn&rsquo;t let anyone
      else prepare for Blossom. Only to think, ma&rsquo;am, she&rsquo;ll be home the day
      after to-morrow. I&rsquo;m just filled clear through, body, soul, and spirit,
      with joy to think of having my little Blossom at home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blewett smiled sourly. When Mrs. Blewett smiled it foretokened
      trouble, and wise people had learned to have sudden business elsewhere
      before the smile could be translated into words. But Old Man Shaw had
      never learned to be wise where Mrs. Blewett was concerned, although she
      had been his nearest neighbour for years, and had pestered his life out
      with advice and &ldquo;neighbourly turns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blewett was one with whom life had gone awry. The effect on her was
      to render happiness to other people a personal insult. She resented Old
      Man Shaw&rsquo;s beaming delight in his daughter&rsquo;s return, and she &ldquo;considered
      it her duty&rdquo; to rub the bloom off straightway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Sary&rsquo;ll be contented in White Sands now?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Shaw looked slightly bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;ll be contented,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it her home? And
      ain&rsquo;t I here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blewett smiled again, with double distilled contempt for such
      simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a good thing you&rsquo;re so sure of it, I suppose. If &lsquo;twas my
      daughter that was coming back to White Sands, after three years of
      fashionable life among rich, stylish folks, and at a swell school, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have a minute&rsquo;s peace of mind. I&rsquo;d know perfectly well that she&rsquo;d
      look down on everything here, and be discontented and miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOUR daughter might,&rdquo; said Old Man Shaw, with more sarcasm than he had
      supposed he had possessed, &ldquo;but Blossom won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blewett shrugged her sharp shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe not. It&rsquo;s to be hoped not, for both your sakes, I&rsquo;m sure. But I&rsquo;d
      be worried if &lsquo;twas me. Sary&rsquo;s been living among fine folks, and having a
      gay, exciting time, and it stands to reason she&rsquo;ll think White Sands
      fearful lonesome and dull. Look at Lauretta Bradley. She was up in Boston
      for just a month last winter and she&rsquo;s never been able to endure White
      Sands since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lauretta Bradley and Sara Shaw are two different people,&rdquo; said Sara&rsquo;s
      father, trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your house, too,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Blewett ruthlessly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a
      queer, little, old place. What&rsquo;ll she think of it after her aunt&rsquo;s? I&rsquo;ve
      heard tell Mrs. Adair lives in a perfect palace. I&rsquo;ll just warn you kindly
      that Sary&rsquo;ll probably look down on you, and you might as well be prepared
      for it. Of course, I suppose she kind of thinks she has to come back,
      seeing she promised you so solemn she would. But I&rsquo;m certain she doesn&rsquo;t
      want to, and I don&rsquo;t blame her either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Mrs. Blewett had to stop for breath, and Old Man Shaw found his
      opportunity. He had listened, dazed and shrinking, as if she were dealing
      him physical blows, but now a swift change swept over him. His blue eyes
      flashed ominously, straight into Mrs. Blewett&rsquo;s straggling, ferrety gray
      orbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re said your say, Martha Blewett, you can go,&rdquo; he said
      passionately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to listen to another such word. Take yourself
      out of my sight, and your malicious tongue out of my hearing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blewett went, too dumfounded by such an unheard-of outburst in mild
      Old Man Shaw to say a word of defence or attack. When she had gone Old Man
      Shaw, the fire all faded from his eyes, sank back on his bench. His
      delight was dead; his heart was full of pain and bitterness. Martha
      Blewett was a warped and ill-natured woman, but he feared there was
      altogether too much truth in what she said. Why had he never thought of it
      before? Of course White Sands would seem dull and lonely to Blossom; of
      course the little gray house where she was born would seem a poor abode
      after the splendours of her aunt&rsquo;s home. Old Man Shaw walked through his
      garden and looked at everything with new eyes. How poor and simple
      everything was! How sagging and weather-beaten the old house! He went in,
      and up-stairs to Sara&rsquo;s room. It was neat and clean, just as she had left
      it three years ago. But it was small and dark; the ceiling was
      discoloured, the furniture old-fashioned and shabby; she would think it a
      poor, mean place. Even the orchard over the hill brought him no comfort
      now. Blossom would not care for orchards. She would be ashamed of her
      stupid old father and the barren farm. She would hate White Sands, and
      chafe at the dull existence, and look down on everything that went to make
      up his uneventful life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Shaw was unhappy enough that night to have satisfied even Mrs.
      Blewett had she known. He saw himself as he thought White Sands folk must
      see him&mdash;a poor, shiftless, foolish old man, who had only one thing
      in the world worthwhile, his little girl, and had not been of enough
      account to keep her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Blossom, Blossom!&rdquo; he said, and when he spoke her name it sounded as
      if he spoke the name of one dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little the worst sting passed away. He refused to believe long
      that Blossom would be ashamed of him; he knew she would not. Three years
      could not so alter her loyal nature&mdash;no, nor ten times three years.
      But she would be changed&mdash;she would have grown away from him in those
      three busy, brilliant years. His companionship could no longer satisfy
      her. How simple and childish he had been to expect it! She would be sweet
      and kind&mdash;Blossom could never be anything else. She would not show
      open discontent or dissatisfaction; she would not be like Lauretta
      Bradley; but it would be there, and he would divine it, and it would break
      his heart. Mrs. Blewett was right. When he had given Blossom up he should
      not have made a half-hearted thing of his sacrifice&mdash;he should not
      have bound her to come back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked about in his little garden until late at night, under the stars,
      with the sea crooning and calling to him down the slope. When he finally
      went to bed he did not sleep, but lay until morning with tear-wet eyes and
      despair in his heart. All the forenoon he went about his usual daily work
      absently. Frequently he fell into long reveries, standing motionless
      wherever he happened to be, and looking dully before him. Only once did he
      show any animation. When he saw Mrs. Blewett coming up the lane he darted
      into the house, locked the door, and listened to her knocking in grim
      silence. After she had gone he went out, and found a plate of fresh
      doughnuts, covered with a napkin, placed on the bench at the door. Mrs.
      Blewett meant to indicate thus that she bore him no malice for her curt
      dismissal the day before; possibly her conscience gave her some twinges
      also. But her doughnuts could not minister to the mind she had diseased.
      Old Man Shaw took them up; carried them to the pig-pen, and fed them to
      the pigs. It was the first spiteful thing he had done in his life, and he
      felt a most immoral satisfaction in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In mid-afternoon he went out to the garden, finding the new loneliness of
      the little house unbearable. The old bench was warm in the sunshine. Old
      Man Shaw sat down with a long sigh, and dropped his white head wearily on
      his breast. He had decided what he must do. He would tell Blossom that she
      might go back to her aunt and never mind about him&mdash;he would do very
      well by himself and he did not blame her in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still sitting broodingly there when a girl came up the lane. She
      was tall and straight, and walked with a kind of uplift in her motion, as
      if it would be rather easier to fly than not. She was dark, with a rich
      dusky sort of darkness, suggestive of the bloom on purple plums, or the
      glow of deep red apples among bronze leaves. Her big brown eyes lingered
      on everything in sight, and little gurgles of sound now and again came
      through her parted lips, as if inarticulate joy were thus expressing
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the garden gate she saw the bent figure on the old bench, and the next
      minute she was flying along the rose walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;daddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Shaw stood up in hasty bewilderment; then a pair of girlish arms
      were about his neck, and a pair of warm red lips were on his; girlish
      eyes, full of love, were looking up into his, and a never-forgotten voice,
      tingling with laughter and tears blended into one delicious chord, was
      crying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, daddy, is it really you? Oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you how good it is to see
      you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Shaw held her tightly in a silence of amazement and joy too deep
      for wonder. Why, this was his Blossom&mdash;the very Blossom who had gone
      away three years ago! A little taller, a little more womanly, but his own
      dear Blossom, and no stranger. There was a new heaven and a new earth for
      him in the realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Baby Blossom!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;Little Baby Blossom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sara rubbed her cheek against the faded coat sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy darling, this moment makes up for everything, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;where did you come from?&rdquo; he asked, his senses
      beginning to struggle out of their bewilderment of surprise. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      expect you till to-morrow. You didn&rsquo;t have to walk from the station, did
      you? And your old daddy not there to welcome you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sara laughed, swung herself back by the tips of her fingers and danced
      around him in the childish fashion of long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found I could make an earlier connection with the C.P.A. yesterday and
      get to the Island last night. I was in such a fever to get home that I
      jumped at the chance. Of course I walked from the station&mdash;it&rsquo;s only
      two miles and every step was a benediction. My trunks are over there.
      We&rsquo;ll go after them to-morrow, daddy, but just now I want to go straight
      to every one of the dear old nooks and spots at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must get something to eat first,&rdquo; he urged fondly. &ldquo;And there ain&rsquo;t
      much in the house, I&rsquo;m afraid. I was going to bake to-morrow morning. But
      I guess I can forage you out something, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sorely repenting having given Mrs. Blewett&rsquo;s doughnuts to the pigs,
      but Sara brushed all such considerations aside with a wave of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything to eat just now. By and by we&rsquo;ll have a snack; just
      as we used to get up for ourselves whenever we felt hungry. Don&rsquo;t you
      remember how scandalized White Sands folks used to be at our irregular
      hours? I&rsquo;m hungry; but it&rsquo;s soul hunger, for a glimpse of all the dear old
      rooms and places. Come&mdash;there are four hours yet before sunset, and I
      want to cram into them all I&rsquo;ve missed out of these three years. Let us
      begin right here with the garden. Oh, daddy, by what witchcraft have you
      coaxed that sulky rose-bush into bloom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No witchcraft at all&mdash;it just bloomed because you were coming home,
      baby,&rdquo; said her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a glorious afternoon of it, those two children. They explored the
      garden and then the house. Sara danced through every room, and then up to
      her own, holding fast to her father&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s lovely to see my little room again, daddy. I&rsquo;m sure all my old
      hopes and dreams are waiting here for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the window and threw it open, leaning out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy, there&rsquo;s no view in the world so beautiful as that curve of sea
      between the headlands. I&rsquo;ve looked at magnificent scenery&mdash;and then
      I&rsquo;d shut my eyes and conjure up that picture. Oh, listen to the wind
      keening in the trees! How I&rsquo;ve longed for that music!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her to the orchard and followed out his crafty plan of surprise
      perfectly. She rewarded him by doing exactly what he had dreamed of her
      doing, clapping her hands and crying out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, daddy! Why, daddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They finished up with the shore, and then at sunset they came back and sat
      down on the old garden bench. Before them a sea of splendour, burning like
      a great jewel, stretched to the gateways of the west. The long headlands
      on either side were darkly purple, and the sun left behind him a vast,
      cloudless arc of fiery daffodil and elusive rose. Back over the orchard in
      a cool, green sky glimmered a crystal planet, and the night poured over
      them a clear wine of dew from her airy chalice. The spruces were rejoicing
      in the wind, and even the battered firs were singing of the sea. Old
      memories trooped into their hearts like shining spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baby Blossom,&rdquo; said Old Man Shaw falteringly, &ldquo;are you quite sure you&rsquo;ll
      be contented here? Out there&rdquo;&mdash;with a vague sweep of his hand towards
      horizons that shut out a world far removed from White Sands&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      pleasure and excitement and all that. Won&rsquo;t you miss it? Won&rsquo;t you get
      tired of your old father and White Sands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sara patted his hand gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world out there is a good place,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
      three splendid years and I hope they&rsquo;ll enrich my whole life. There are
      wonderful things out there to see and learn, fine, noble people to meet,
      beautiful deeds to admire; but,&rdquo; she wound her arm about his neck and laid
      her cheek against his&mdash;&ldquo;there is no daddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Old Man Shaw looked silently at the sunset&mdash;or, rather, through
      the sunset to still grander and more radiant splendours beyond, of which
      the things seen were only the pale reflections, not worthy of attention
      from those who had the gift of further sight.

    <h2>
      VII. Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s Beau
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aunt Olivia told Peggy and me about him on the afternoon we went over to
      help her gather her late roses for pot-pourri. We found her strangely
      quiet and preoccupied. As a rule she was fond of mild fun, alert to hear
      East Grafton gossip, and given to sudden little trills of almost girlish
      laughter, which for the time being dispelled the atmosphere of gentle
      old-maidishness which seemed to hang about her as a garment. At such
      moments we did not find it hard to believe&mdash;as we did at other times&mdash;that
      Aunt Olivia had once been a girl herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day she picked the roses absently, and shook the fairy petals into
      her little sweet-grass basket with the air of a woman whose thoughts were
      far away. We said nothing, knowing that Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s secrets always came
      our way in time. When the rose-leaves were picked, we carried them in and
      upstairs in single file, Aunt Olivia bringing up the rear to pick up any
      stray rose-leaf we might drop. In the south-west room, where there was no
      carpet to fade, we spread them on newspapers on the floor. Then we put our
      sweet-grass baskets back in the proper place in the proper closet in the
      proper room. What would have happened to us, or to the sweet-grass
      baskets, if this had not been done I do not know. Nothing was ever
      permitted to remain an instant out of place in Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we went downstairs, Aunt Olivia asked us to go into the parlour. She
      had something to tell us, she said, and as she opened the door a delicate
      pink flush spread over her face. I noted it, with surprise, but no inkling
      of the truth came to me&mdash;for nobody ever connected the idea of
      possible lovers or marriage with this prim little old maid, Olivia
      Sterling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s parlour was much like herself&mdash;painfully neat. Every
      article of furniture stood in exactly the same place it had always stood.
      Nothing was ever suffered to be disturbed. The tassels of the crazy
      cushion lay just so over the arm of the sofa, and the crochet antimacassar
      was always spread at precisely the same angle over the horsehair rocking
      chair. No speck of dust was ever visible; no fly ever invaded that sacred
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Olivia pulled up a blind, to let in what light could sift finely
      through the vine leaves, and sat down in a high-backed old chair that had
      appertained to her great-grandmother. She folded her hands in her lap, and
      looked at us with shy appeal in her blue-gray eyes. Plainly she found it
      hard to tell us her secret, yet all the time there was an air of pride and
      exultation about her; somewhat, also, of a new dignity. Aunt Olivia could
      never be self-assertive, but if it had been possible that would have been
      her time for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard me speak of Mr. Malcolm MacPherson?&rdquo; asked Aunt
      Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had never heard her, or anybody else, speak of Mr. Malcolm MacPherson;
      but volumes of explanation could not have told us more about him than did
      Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s voice when she pronounced his name. We knew, as if it had
      been proclaimed to us in trumpet tones, that Mr. Malcolm MacPherson must
      be Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s beau, and the knowledge took away our breath. We even
      forgot to be curious, so astonished were we.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there sat Aunt Olivia, proud and shy and exulting and shamefaced, all
      at once!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a brother of Mrs. John Seaman&rsquo;s across the bridge,&rdquo; explained Aunt
      Olivia with a little simper. &ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t remember him. He went
      out to British Columbia twenty years ago. But he is coming home now&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;tell
      your father, won&rsquo;t you&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t like to tell him&mdash;Mr.
      Malcolm MacPherson and I are going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married!&rdquo; gasped Peggy. And &ldquo;married!&rdquo; I echoed stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Olivia bridled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing unsuitable in that, is there?&rdquo; she asked, rather
      crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; I hastened to assure her, giving Peggy a surreptitious kick
      to divert her thoughts from laughter. &ldquo;Only you must realize, Aunt Olivia,
      that this is a very great surprise to us.&rdquo; &ldquo;I thought it would be so,&rdquo;
       said Aunt Olivia complacently. &ldquo;But your father will know&mdash;he will
      remember. I do hope he won&rsquo;t think me foolish. He did not think Mr.
      Malcolm MacPherson was a fit person for me to marry once. But that was
      long ago, when Mr. Malcolm MacPherson was very poor. He is in very
      comfortable circumstances now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about it, Aunt Olivia,&rdquo; said Peggy. She did not look at me, which
      was my salvation. Had I caught Peggy&rsquo;s eye when Aunt Olivia said &ldquo;Mr.
      Malcolm MacPherson&rdquo; in that tone I must have laughed, willy-nilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was a girl the MacPhersons used to live across the road from here.
      Mr. Malcolm MacPherson was my beau then. But my family&mdash;and your
      father especially&mdash;dear me, I do hope he won&rsquo;t be very cross&mdash;were
      opposed to his attentions and were very cool to him. I think that was why
      he never said anything to me about getting married then. And after a time
      he went away, as I have said, and I never heard anything from him directly
      for many a year. Of course, his sister sometimes gave me news of him. But
      last June I had a letter from him. He said he was coming home to settle
      down for good on the old Island, and he asked me if I would marry him. I
      wrote back and said I would. Perhaps I ought to have consulted your
      father, but I was afraid he would think I ought to refuse Mr. Malcolm
      MacPherson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think father will mind,&rdquo; said Peggy reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, because, of course, I would consider it my duty in any case
      to fulfil the promise I have given to Mr. Malcolm MacPherson. He will be
      in Grafton next week, the guest of his sister, Mrs. John Seaman, across
      the bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Olivia said that exactly as if she were reading it from the personal
      column of the Daily Enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is the wedding to be?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Aunt Olivia blushed distressfully. &ldquo;I do not know the exact date.
      Nothing can be definitely settled until Mr. Malcolm MacPherson comes. But
      it will not be before September, at the earliest. There will be so much to
      do. You will tell your father, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We promised that we would, and Aunt Olivia arose with an air of relief.
      Peggy and I hurried over home, stopping, when we were safely out of
      earshot, to laugh. The romances of the middle-aged may be to them as
      tender and sweet as those of youth, but they are apt to possess a good
      deal of humour for onlookers. Only youth can be sentimental without being
      mirth-provoking. We loved Aunt Olivia and were glad for her late,
      new-blossoming happiness; but we felt amused over it also. The
      recollection of her &ldquo;Mr. Malcolm MacPherson&rdquo; was too much for us every
      time we thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father pooh-poohed incredulously at first, and, when we had convinced him,
      guffawed with laughter. Aunt Olivia need not have dreaded any more
      opposition from her cruel family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MacPherson was a good fellow enough, but horribly poor,&rdquo; said father. &ldquo;I
      hear he has done very well out west, and if he and Olivia have a notion of
      each other they are welcome to marry as far as I am concerned. Tell Olivia
      she mustn&rsquo;t take a spasm if he tracks some mud into her house once in a
      while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was all arranged, and, before we realized it at all, Aunt Olivia
      was mid-deep in marriage preparations, in all of which Peggy and I were
      quite indispensable. She consulted us in regard to everything, and we
      almost lived at her place in those days preceding the arrival of Mr.
      Malcolm MacPherson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Olivia plainly felt very happy and important. She had always wished
      to be married; she was not in the least strong-minded and her
      old-maidenhood had always been a sore point with her. I think she looked
      upon it as somewhat of a disgrace. And yet she was a born old maid;
      looking at her, and taking all her primness and little set ways into
      consideration, it was quite impossible to picture her as the wife of Mr.
      Malcolm MacPherson, or anybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      We soon discovered that, to Aunt Olivia, Mr. Malcolm MacPherson
      represented a merely abstract proposition&mdash;the man who was to confer
      on her the long-withheld dignity of matronhood. Her romance began and
      ended there, although she was quite unconscious of this herself, and
      believed that she was deeply in love with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will be the result, Mary, when he arrives in the flesh and she is
      compelled to deal with &lsquo;Mr. Malcolm MacPherson&rsquo; as a real, live man,
      instead of a nebulous &lsquo;party of the second part&rsquo; in the marriage
      ceremony?&rdquo; queried Peggy, as she hemmed table-napkins for Aunt Olivia,
      sitting on her well-scoured sandstone steps, and carefully putting all
      thread-clippings and ravellings into the little basket which Aunt Olivia
      had placed there for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may transform her from a self-centered old maid into a woman for whom
      marriage does not seem such an incongruous thing,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day on which Mr. Malcolm MacPherson was expected Peggy and I went
      over. We had planned to remain away, thinking that the lovers would prefer
      their first meeting to be unwitnessed, but Aunt Olivia insisted on our
      being present. She was plainly nervous; the abstract was becoming
      concrete. Her little house was in spotless, speckless order from top to
      bottom. Aunt Olivia had herself scrubbed the garret floor and swept the
      cellar steps that very morning with as much painstaking care as if she
      expected that Mr. Malcolm MacPherson would hasten to inspect each at once
      and she must stand or fall by his opinion of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy and I helped her to dress. She insisted on wearing her best black
      silk, in which she looked unnaturally fine. Her soft muslin became her
      much better, but we could not induce her to wear it. Anything more prim
      and bandboxy than Aunt Olivia when her toilet was finished it has never
      been my lot to see. Peggy and I watched her as she went downstairs, her
      skirt held stiffly up all around her that it might not brush the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Malcolm MacPherson&rsquo; will be inspired with such awe that he will only
      be able to sit back and gaze at her,&rdquo; whispered Peggy. &ldquo;I wish he would
      come and have it over. This is getting on my nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Olivia went into the parlour, settled herself in the old carved
      chair, and folded her hands. Peggy and I sat down on the stairs to await
      his coming in a crisping suspense. Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s kitten, a fat,
      bewhiskered creature, looking as if it were cut out of black velvet,
      shared our vigil and purred in maddening peace of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could see the garden path and gate through the hall window, and
      therefore supposed we should have full warning of the approach of Mr.
      Malcolm MacPherson. It was no wonder, therefore, that we positively jumped
      when a thunderous knock crashed against the front door and re-echoed
      through the house. Had Mr. Malcolm MacPherson dropped from the skies?
    </p>
    <p>
      We afterwards discovered that he had come across lots and around the house
      from the back, but just then his sudden advent was almost uncanny. I ran
      downstairs and opened the door. On the step stood a man about six feet two
      in height, and proportionately broad and sinewy. He had splendid
      shoulders, a great crop of curly black hair, big, twinkling blue eyes, and
      a tremendous crinkly black beard that fell over his breast in shining
      waves. In brief, Mr. Malcolm MacPherson was what one would call
      instinctively, if somewhat tritely, &ldquo;a magnificent specimen of manhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one hand he carried a bunch of early goldenrod and smoke-blue asters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; he said in a resonant voice which seemed to take
      possession of the drowsy summer afternoon. &ldquo;Is Miss Olivia Sterling in?
      And will you please tell her that Malcolm MacPherson is here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I showed him into the parlour. Then Peggy and I peeped through the crack
      of the door. Anyone would have done it. We would have scorned to excuse
      ourselves. And, indeed, what we saw would have been worth several
      conscience spasms if we had felt any.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Olivia arose and advanced primly, with outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. MacPherson, I am very glad to see you,&rdquo; she said formally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s yourself, Nillie!&rdquo; Mr. Malcolm MacPherson gave two strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his flowers on the floor, knocked over a small table, and sent
      the ottoman spinning against the wall. Then he caught Aunt Olivia in his
      arms and&mdash;smack, smack, smack! Peggy sank back upon the stair-step
      with her handkerchief stuffed in her mouth. Aunt Olivia was being kissed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, Mr. Malcolm MacPherson held her back at arm&rsquo;s length in his big
      paws and looked her over. I saw Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s eyes roam over his arm to
      the inverted table and the litter of asters and goldenrod. Her sleek
      crimps were all ruffled up, and her lace fichu twisted half around her
      neck. She looked distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bit changed you are, Nillie,&rdquo; said Mr. Malcolm MacPherson
      admiringly. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s good I&rsquo;m feeling to see you again. Are you glad to
      see me, Nillie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She twisted herself free and went to set up the table. Then she turned to
      the flowers, but Mr. Malcolm MacPherson had already gathered them up,
      leaving a goodly sprinkling of leaves and stalks on the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I picked these for you in the river field, Nillie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where will
      I be getting something to stick them in? Here, this will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grasped a frail, painted vase on the mantel, stuffed the flowers in it,
      and set it on the table. The look on Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s face was too much for
      me at last. I turned, caught Peggy by the shoulder and dragged her out of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will horrify the very soul out of Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s body if he goes on
      like this,&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s splendid&mdash;and he thinks the world of
      her&mdash;and, oh, Peggy, did you EVER hear such kisses? Fancy Aunt
      Olivia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not take us long to get well acquainted with Mr. Malcolm
      MacPherson. He almost haunted Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s house, and Aunt Olivia
      insisted on our staying with her most of the time. She seemed to be very
      shy of finding herself alone with him. He horrified her a dozen times in
      an hour; nevertheless, she was very proud of him, and liked to be teased
      about him, too. She was delighted that we admired him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though, to be sure, he is very different in his looks from what he used
      to be,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is so dreadfully big! And I do not like a beard, but
      I have not the courage to ask him to shave it off. He might be offended.
      He has bought the old Lynde place in Avonlea and wants to be married in a
      month. But, dear me, that is too soon. It&mdash;it would be hardly
      proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peggy and I liked Mr. Malcolm MacPherson very much. So did father. We were
      glad that he seemed to think Aunt Olivia perfection. He was as happy as
      the day was long; but poor Aunt Olivia, under all her surface pride and
      importance, was not. Amid all the humour of the circumstances Peggy and I
      snuffed tragedy compounded with the humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Malcolm MacPherson could never be trained to old-maidishness, and even
      Aunt Olivia seemed to realize this. He never stopped to clear his boots
      when he came in, although she had an ostentatiously new scraper put at
      each door for his benefit. He seldom moved in the house without knocking
      some of Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s treasures over. He smoked cigars in her parlour and
      scattered the ashes over the floor. He brought her flowers every day and
      stuck them into whatever receptacle came handiest. He sat on her cushions
      and rolled her antimacassars up into balls. He put his feet on her chair
      rungs&mdash;and all with the most distracting unconsciousness of doing
      anything out of the way. He never noticed Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s fluttering
      nervousness at all. Peggy and I laughed more than was good for us those
      days. It was so funny to see Aunt Olivia hovering anxiously around,
      picking up flower stems, and smoothing out tidies, and generally following
      him about to straighten out things. Once she even got a wing and dustpan
      and swept the cigar ashes under his very eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be worrying yourself over that, Nillie,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Why, I
      don&rsquo;t mind a litter, bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How good and jolly he was, that Mr. Malcolm MacPherson! Such songs as he
      sang, such stories as he told, such a breezy, unconventional atmosphere as
      he brought into that prim little house, where stagnant dullness had
      reigned for years! He worshipped Aunt Olivia, and his worship took the
      concrete form of presents galore. He brought her a present almost every
      visit&mdash;generally some article of jewelry. Bracelets, rings, chains,
      ear-drops, lockets, bangles, were showered upon our precise little aunt;
      she accepted them deprecatingly, but never wore them. This hurt him a
      little, but she assured him she would wear them all sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not used to jewelry, Mr. MacPherson,&rdquo; she would tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her engagement ring she did wear&mdash;it was a rather &ldquo;loud&rdquo; combination
      of engraved gold and opals. Sometimes we caught her turning it on her
      finger with a very troubled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would be sorry for Mr. Malcolm MacPherson if he were not so much in
      love with her,&rdquo; said Peggy. &ldquo;But as he thinks that she is perfection he
      doesn&rsquo;t need sympathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for Aunt Olivia,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Yes, Peggy, I am. Mr. MacPherson is
      a splendid man, but Aunt Olivia is a born old maid, and it is outraging
      her very nature to be anything else. Don&rsquo;t you see how it&rsquo;s hurting her?
      His big, splendid man-ways are harrowing her very soul up&mdash;she can&rsquo;t
      get out of her little, narrow groove, and it is killing her to be pulled
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Peggy. Then she added with a laugh,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, did you ever see anything so funny as Aunt Olivia sitting on &lsquo;Mr.
      Malcolm MacPherson&rsquo;s&rsquo; knee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It WAS funny. Aunt Olivia thought it very unbecoming to sit there before
      us, but he made her do it. He would say, with his big, jolly laugh, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      be minding the little girls,&rdquo; and pull her down on his knee and hold her
      there. To my dying day I shall never forget the expression on the poor
      little woman&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as the days went by and Mr. Malcolm MacPherson began to insist on a
      date being set for the wedding, Aunt Olivia grew to have a strangely
      disturbed look. She became very quiet, and never laughed except under
      protest. Also, she showed signs of petulance when any of us, but
      especially father, teased her about her beau. I pitied her, for I think I
      understood better than the others what her feelings really were. But even
      I was not prepared for what did happen. I would not have believed that
      Aunt Olivia could do it. I thought that her desire for marriage in the
      abstract would outweigh the disadvantages of the concrete. But one can
      never reckon with real, bred-in-the-bone old-maidism.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Mr. Malcolm MacPherson told us all that he was coming up that
      evening to make Aunt Olivia set the day. Peggy and I laughingly approved,
      telling him that it was high time for him to assert his authority, and he
      went off in great good humour across the river field, whistling a Highland
      strathspey. But Aunt Olivia looked like a martyr. She had a fierce attack
      of housecleaning that day, and put everything in flawless order, even to
      the corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if there was going to be a funeral in the house,&rdquo; sniffed Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy and I were up in the south-west room at dusk that evening, piecing a
      quilt, when we heard Mr. Malcolm MacPherson shouting out in the hall below
      to know if anyone was home. I ran out to the landing, but as I did so Aunt
      Olivia came out of her room, brushed past me, and flitted downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. MacPherson,&rdquo; I heard her say with double-distilled primness, &ldquo;will
      you please come into the parlour? I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went in, and I returned to the south-west room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peg, there&rsquo;s trouble brewing,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it by Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s
      face, it was GRAY. And she has gone down ALONE&mdash;and shut the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to hear what she says to him,&rdquo; said Peggy resolutely. &ldquo;It is
      her own fault&mdash;she has spoiled us by always insisting that we should
      be present at their interviews. That poor man has had to do his courting
      under our very eyes. Come on, Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The south-west room was directly over the parlour and there was an open
      stovepipe-hole leading up therefrom. Peggy removed the hat box that was on
      it, and we both deliberately and shamelessly crouched down and listened
      with all our might.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy enough to hear what Mr. Malcolm MacPherson was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come up to get the date settled, Nillie, as I told you. Come now,
      little woman, name the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      SMACK!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Mr. MacPherson,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia. She spoke as a woman who has
      keyed herself up to the doing of some very distasteful task and is anxious
      to have it over and done with as soon as possible. &ldquo;There is something I
      must say to you. I cannot marry you, Mr. MacPherson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. I would have given much to have seen the pair of them.
      When Mr. Malcolm MacPherson spoke his voice was that of blank,
      uncomprehending amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nillie, what is it you are meaning?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot marry you, Mr. MacPherson,&rdquo; repeated Aunt Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Surprise was giving way to dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will understand, Mr. MacPherson,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia,
      faintly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t realize what it means for a woman to give up
      everything&mdash;her own home and friends and all her past life, so to
      speak, and go far away with a stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose it will be rather hard. But, Nillie, Avonlea isn&rsquo;t very
      far away&mdash;not more than twelve miles, if it will be that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve miles! It might as well be at the other side of the world to all
      intents and purposes,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia obstinately. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a
      living soul there, except Rachel Lynde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so before I bought the place, then? But it&rsquo;s not too
      late. I can be selling it and buying right here in East Grafton if that
      will please you&mdash;though there isn&rsquo;t half as nice a place to be had.
      But I&rsquo;ll fix it up somehow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. MacPherson,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia firmly, &ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t cover the
      difficulty. I knew you would not understand. My ways are not your ways and
      I cannot make them over. For&mdash;you track mud in&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;you
      don&rsquo;t care whether things are tidy or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Aunt Olivia had to be Aunt Olivia; if she were being burned at the
      stake I verily believe she would have dragged some grotesqueness into the
      tragedy of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said Mr. Malcolm MacPherson&mdash;not profanely or angrily,
      but as in sheer bewilderment. Then he added, &ldquo;Nillie, you must be joking.
      It&rsquo;s careless enough I am&mdash;the west isn&rsquo;t a good place to learn
      finicky ways&mdash;but you can teach me. You&rsquo;re not going to throw me over
      because I track mud in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot marry you, Mr. MacPherson,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be meaning it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, because he was beginning to
      understand that she did mean it, although it was impossible for his man
      mind to understand anything else about the puzzle. &ldquo;Nillie, it&rsquo;s breaking
      my heart you are! I&rsquo;ll do anything&mdash;go anywhere&mdash;be anything you
      want&mdash;only don&rsquo;t be going back on me like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot marry you, Mr. MacPherson,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia for the fourth
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nillie!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Malcolm MacPherson. There was such real agony in
      his tone that Peggy and I were suddenly stricken with contrition. What
      were we doing? We had no right to be listening to this pitiful interview.
      The pain and protest in his voice had suddenly banished all the humour
      from it, and left naught but the bare, stark tragedy. We rose and tiptoed
      out of the room, wholesomely ashamed of ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Malcolm MacPherson had gone, after an hour of useless pleading,
      Aunt Olivia came up to us, pale and prim and determined, and told us that
      there was to be no wedding. We could not pretend surprise, but Peggy
      ventured a faint protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aunt Olivia, do you think you have done right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the only thing I could do,&rdquo; said Aunt Olivia stonily. &ldquo;I could not
      marry Mr. Malcolm MacPherson and I told him so. Please tell your father&mdash;and
      kindly say nothing more to me about the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Aunt Olivia went downstairs, got a broom, and swept up the mud Mr.
      Malcolm MacPherson had tracked over the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy and I went home and told father. We felt very flat, but there was
      nothing to be done or said. Father laughed at the whole thing, but I could
      not laugh. I was sorry for Mr. Malcolm MacPherson and, though I was angry
      with her, I was sorry for Aunt Olivia, too. Plainly she felt badly enough
      over her vanished hopes and plans, but she had developed a strange and
      baffling reserve which nothing could pierce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but a chronic case of old-maidism,&rdquo; said father impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were very dull for a week. We saw no more of Mr. Malcolm MacPherson
      and we missed him dreadfully. Aunt Olivia was inscrutable, and worked with
      fierceness at superfluous tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening father came home with some news. &ldquo;Malcolm MacPherson is
      leaving on the 7:30 train for the west,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He has rented the
      Avonlea place and he&rsquo;s off. They say he is mad as a hatter at the trick
      Olivia played on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After tea Peggy and I went over to see Aunt Olivia, who had asked our
      advice about a wrapper. She was sewing as for dear life, and her face was
      primmer and colder than ever. I wondered if she knew of Mr. Malcolm
      MacPherson&rsquo;s departure. Delicacy forbade me to mention it but Peggy had no
      such scruples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Aunt Olivia, your beau is off,&rdquo; she announced cheerfully. &ldquo;You
      won&rsquo;t be bothered with him again. He is leaving on the mail train for the
      west.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Olivia dropped her sewing and stood up. I have never seen anything
      like the transformation that came over her. It was so thorough and sudden
      as to be almost uncanny. The old maid vanished completely, and in her
      place was a woman, full to the lips with primitive emotion and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she cried in a terrible voice. &ldquo;Mary&mdash;Peggy&mdash;what
      shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was almost a shriek. Peggy turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care?&rdquo; she said stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care! Girls, I shall DIE if Malcolm MacPherson goes away! I have been mad&mdash;I
      must have been mad. I have almost died of loneliness since I sent him
      away. But I thought he would come back! I must see him&mdash;there is time
      to reach the station before the train goes if I go by the fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took a wild step towards the door, but I caught her back with a sudden
      mind-vision of Aunt Olivia flying bareheaded and distraught across the
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment, Aunt Olivia. Peggy, run home and get father to harness
      Dick in the buggy as quickly as he can. We&rsquo;ll drive Aunt Olivia to the
      station. We&rsquo;ll get you there in time, Aunty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peggy flew, and Aunt Olivia dashed upstairs. I lingered behind to pick up
      her sewing, and when I got to her room she had her hat and cape on. Spread
      out on the bed were all the boxes of gifts which Mr. Malcolm MacPherson
      had brought her, and Aunt Olivia was stringing their contents feverishly
      about her person. Rings, three brooches, a locket, three chains and a
      watch all went on&mdash;anyway and anyhow. A wonderful sight it was to see
      Aunt Olivia bedizened like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would never wear them before&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll put them all on now to show
      him I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she gasped, with trembling lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the three of us crowded into the buggy, Aunt Olivia grasped the whip
      before we could prevent her and, leaning out, gave poor Dick such a lash
      as he had never felt in his life before. He went tearing down the steep,
      stony, fast-darkening road in a fashion which made Peggy and me cry out in
      alarm. Aunt Olivia was usually the most timid of women, but now she didn&rsquo;t
      seem to know what fear was. She kept whipping and urging poor Dick the
      whole way to the station, quite oblivious to our assurances that there was
      plenty of time. The people who met us that night must have thought we were
      quite mad. I held on the reins, Peggy gripped the swaying side of the
      buggy, and Aunt Olivia bent forward, hat and hair blowing back from her
      set face with its strangely crimson cheeks, and plied the whip. In such a
      guise did we whirl through the village and over the two-mile station road.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we drove up to the station, where the train was shunting amid the
      shadows, Aunt Olivia made a flying leap from the buggy and ran along the
      platform, with her cape streaming behind her and all her brooches and
      chains glittering in the lights. I tossed the reins to a boy standing near
      and we followed. Just under the glare of the station lamp we saw Mr.
      Malcolm MacPherson, grip in hand. Fortunately no one else was very near,
      but it would have been all the same had they been the centre of a crowd.
      Aunt Olivia fairly flung herself against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malcolm,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go&mdash;don&rsquo;t go&mdash;I&rsquo;ll marry you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      go anywhere&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t care how much mud you bring in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That truly Aunt Olivia touch relieved the tension of the situation a
      little. Mr. MacPherson put his arm about her and drew her back into the
      shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; he soothed. &ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t be going. Don&rsquo;t cry,
      Nillie-girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll come right back with me now?&rdquo; implored Aunt Olivia, clinging
      to him as if she feared he would be whisked away from her yet if she let
      go for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy got a chance home with a friend, and Aunt Olivia and Mr. Malcolm
      MacPherson and I drove back in the buggy. Mr. MacPherson held Aunt Olivia
      on his knee because there was no room, but she would have sat there, I
      think, had there been a dozen vacant seats. She clung to him in the most
      barefaced fashion, and all her former primness and reserve were swept away
      completely. She kissed him a dozen times or more and told him she loved
      him&mdash;and I did not even smile, nor did I want to. Somehow, it did not
      seem in the least funny to me then, nor does it now, although it doubtless
      will to others. There was too much real intensity of feeling in it all to
      leave any room for the ridiculous. So wrapped up in each other were they
      that I did not even feel superfluous.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set them safely down in Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s yard and turned homeward,
      completely forgotten by the pair. But in the moonlight, which flooded the
      front of the house, I saw something that testified eloquently to the
      transformation in Aunt Olivia. It had rained that afternoon and the yard
      was muddy. Nevertheless, she went in at her front door and took Mr.
      Malcolm MacPherson in with her without even a glance at the scraper!

    <h2>
      VIII. The Quarantine at Alexander Abraham&rsquo;s
    </h2>
    <p>
      I refused to take that class in Sunday School the first time I was asked.
      It was not that I objected to teaching in the Sunday School. On the
      contrary I rather liked the idea; but it was the Rev. Mr. Allan who asked
      me, and it had always been a matter of principle with me never to do
      anything a man asked me to do if I could help it. I was noted for that. It
      saves a great deal of trouble and it simplifies everything beautifully. I
      had always disliked men. It must have been born in me, because, as far
      back as I can remember, an antipathy to men and dogs was one of my
      strongest characteristics. I was noted for that. My experiences through
      life only served to deepen it. The more I saw of men, the more I liked
      cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, of course, when the Rev. Allan asked me if I would consent to take a
      class in Sunday School, I said no in a fashion calculated to chasten him
      wholesomely. If he had sent his wife the first time, as he did the second,
      it would have been wiser. People generally do what Mrs. Allan asks them to
      do because they know it saves time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Allan talked smoothly for half an hour before she mentioned the
      Sunday School, and paid me several compliments. Mrs. Allan is famous for
      her tact. Tact is a faculty for meandering around to a given point instead
      of making a bee-line. I have no tact. I am noted for that. As soon as Mrs.
      Allan&rsquo;s conversation came in sight of the Sunday School, I, who knew all
      along whither it was tending, said, straight out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What class do you want me to teach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Allan was so surprised that she forgot to be tactful, and answered
      plainly for once in her life,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two classes&mdash;one of boys and one of girls&mdash;needing a
      teacher. I have been teaching the girls&rsquo; class, but I shall have to give
      it up for a little time on account of the baby&rsquo;s health. You may have your
      choice, Miss MacPherson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall take the boys,&rdquo; I said decidedly. I am noted for my
      decision. &ldquo;Since they have to grow up to be men it&rsquo;s well to train them
      properly betimes. Nuisances they are bound to become under any
      circumstances; but if they are taken in hand young enough they may not
      grow up to be such nuisances as they otherwise would and that will be some
      unfortunate woman&rsquo;s gain.&rdquo; Mrs. Allan looked dubious. I knew she had
      expected me to choose the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are a very wild set of boys,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew boys who weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;think perhaps you would like the girls best,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Allan hesitatingly. If it had not been for one thing&mdash;which I would
      never in this world have admitted to Mrs. Allan&mdash;I might have liked
      the girls&rsquo; class best myself. But the truth was, Anne Shirley was in that
      class; and Anne Shirley was the one living human being that I was afraid
      of. Not that I disliked her. But she had such a habit of asking weird,
      unexpected questions, which a Philadelphia lawyer couldn&rsquo;t answer. Miss
      Rogerson had that class once and Anne routed her, horse, foot and
      artillery. <i>I</i> wasn&rsquo;t going to undertake a class with a walking
      interrogation point in it like that. Besides, I thought Mrs. Allan
      required a slight snub. Ministers&rsquo; wives are rather apt to think they can
      run everything and everybody, if they are not wholesomely corrected now
      and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not what <i>I</i> like best that must be considered, Mrs. Allan,&rdquo; I
      said rebukingly. &ldquo;It is what is best for those boys. I feel that <i>I</i>
      shall be best for THEM.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve no doubt of that, Miss MacPherson,&rdquo; said Mrs. Allan amiably. It
      was a fib for her, minister&rsquo;s wife though she was. She HAD doubt. She
      thought I would be a dismal failure as teacher of a boys&rsquo; class.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was not. I am not often a dismal failure when I make up my mind to
      do a thing. I am noted for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wonderful what a reformation you have worked in that class, Miss
      MacPherson&mdash;wonderful,&rdquo; said the Rev. Mr. Allan some weeks later. He
      didn&rsquo;t mean to show how amazing a thing he thought it that an old maid
      noted for being a man hater should have managed it, but his face betrayed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does Jimmy Spencer live?&rdquo; I asked him crisply. &ldquo;He came one Sunday
      three weeks ago and hasn&rsquo;t been back since. I mean to find out why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Allan coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he is hired as handy boy with Alexander Abraham Bennett, out on
      the White Sands road,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am going out to Alexander Abraham Bennett&rsquo;s on the White Sands
      road to see why Jimmy Spencer doesn&rsquo;t come to Sunday school,&rdquo; I said
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Allan&rsquo;s eyes twinkled ever so slightly. I have always insisted that if
      that man were not a minister he would have a sense of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly Mr. Bennett will not appreciate your kind interest! He has&mdash;ah&mdash;a
      singular aversion to your sex, I understand. No woman has ever been known
      to get inside of Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s house since his sister died twenty years
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is the one, is he?&rdquo; I said, remembering. &ldquo;He is the woman hater
      who threatens that if a woman comes into his yard he&rsquo;ll chase her out with
      a pitch-fork. Well, he will not chase ME out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Allan gave a chuckle&mdash;a ministerial chuckle, but still a chuckle.
      It irritated me slightly, because it seemed to imply that he thought
      Alexander Abraham Bennett would be one too many for me. But I did not show
      Mr. Allan that he annoyed me. It is always a great mistake to let a man
      see that he can vex you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next afternoon I harnessed my sorrel pony to the buggy and drove down
      to Alexander Abraham Bennett&rsquo;s. As usual, I took William Adolphus with me
      for company. William Adolphus is my favourite among my six cats. He is
      black, with a white dicky and beautiful white paws. He sat up on the seat
      beside me and looked far more like a gentleman than many a man I&rsquo;ve seen
      in a similar position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham&rsquo;s place was about three miles along the White Sands
      road. I knew the house as soon as I came to it by its neglected
      appearance. It needed paint badly; the blinds were crooked and torn; weeds
      grew up to the very door. Plainly, there was no woman about THAT place.
      Still, it was a nice house, and the barns were splendid. My father always
      said that when a man&rsquo;s barns were bigger than his house it was a sign that
      his income exceeded his expenditure. So it was all right that they should
      be bigger; but it was all wrong that they should be trimmer and better
      painted. Still, thought I, what else could you expect of a woman hater?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Alexander Abraham evidently knows how to run a farm, even it he is a
      woman hater,&rdquo; I remarked to William Adolphus as I got out and tied the
      pony to the railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had driven up to the house from the back way and now I was opposite a
      side door opening on the veranda. I thought I might as well go to it, so I
      tucked William Adolphus under my arm and marched up the path. Just as I
      was half-way up, a dog swooped around the front corner and made straight
      for me. He was the ugliest dog I had ever seen; and he didn&rsquo;t even bark&mdash;just
      came silently and speedily on, with a business-like eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never stop to argue matters with a dog that doesn&rsquo;t bark. I know when
      discretion is the better part of valour. Firmly clasping William Adolphus,
      I ran&mdash;not to the door, because the dog was between me and it, but to
      a big, low-branching cherry tree at the back corner of the house. I
      reached it in time and no more. First thrusting William Adolphus on to a
      limb above my head, I scrambled up into that blessed tree without stopping
      to think how it might look to Alexander Abraham if he happened to be
      watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      My time for reflection came when I found myself perched half way up the
      tree with William Adolphus beside me. William Adolphus was quite calm and
      unruffled. I can hardly say with truthfulness what I was. On the contrary,
      I admit that I felt considerably upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog was sitting on his haunches on the ground below, watching us, and
      it was quite plain to be seen, from his leisurely manner, that it was not
      his busy day. He bared his teeth and growled when he caught my eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You LOOK like a woman hater&rsquo;s dog,&rdquo; I told him. I meant it for an insult;
      but the beast took it for a compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I set myself to solving the question, &ldquo;How am I to get out of this
      predicament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem easy to solve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I scream, William Adolphus?&rdquo; I demanded of that intelligent animal.
      William Adolphus shook his head. This is a fact. And I agreed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shall not scream, William Adolphus,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There is probably no
      one to hear me except Alexander Abraham, and I have my painful doubts
      about his tender mercies. Now, it is impossible to go down. Is it, then,
      William Adolphus, possible to go up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked up. Just above my head was an open window with a tolerably stout
      branch extending right across it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we try that way, William Adolphus?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Adolphus, wasting no words, began to climb the tree. I followed
      his example. The dog ran in circles about the tree and looked things not
      lawful to be uttered. It probably would have been a relief to him to bark
      if it hadn&rsquo;t been so against his principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got in by the window easily enough, and found myself in a bedroom the
      like of which for disorder and dust and general awfulness I had never seen
      in all my life. But I did not pause to take in details. With William
      Adolphus under my arm I marched downstairs, fervently hoping I should meet
      no one on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not. The hall below was empty and dusty. I opened the first door I
      came to and walked boldly in. A man was sitting by the window, looking
      moodily out. I should have known him for Alexander Abraham anywhere. He
      had just the same uncared-for, ragged appearance that the house had; and
      yet, like the house, it seemed that he would not be bad looking if he were
      trimmed up a little. His hair looked as if it had never been combed, and
      his whiskers were wild in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me with blank amazement in his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Jimmy Spencer?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;I have come to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he ever let you in?&rdquo; asked the man, staring at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t let me in,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;He chased me all over the lawn, and I
      only saved myself from being torn piecemeal by scrambling up a tree. You
      ought to be prosecuted for keeping such a dog! Where is Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering Alexander Abraham began to laugh in a most unpleasant
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust a woman for getting into a man&rsquo;s house if she has made up her mind
      to,&rdquo; he said disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that it was his intention to vex me I remained cool and collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t particular about getting into your house, Mr. Bennett,&rdquo; I
      said calmly. &ldquo;I had but little choice in the matter. It was get in lest a
      worse fate befall me. It was not you or your house I wanted to see&mdash;although
      I admit that it is worth seeing if a person is anxious to find out how
      dirty a place CAN be. It was Jimmy. For the third and last time&mdash;where
      is Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy is not here,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennett gruffly&mdash;but not quite so
      assuredly. &ldquo;He left last week and hired with a man over at Newbridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; I said, picking up William Adolphus, who had been
      exploring the room with a disdainful air, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t disturb you any longer.
      I shall go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think it would be the wisest thing,&rdquo; said Alexander Abraham&mdash;not
      disagreeably this time, but reflectively, as if there was some doubt about
      the matter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you out by the back door. Then the&mdash;ahem!&mdash;the
      dog will not interfere with you. Please go away quietly and quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered if Alexander Abraham thought I would go away with a whoop. But
      I said nothing, thinking this the most dignified course of conduct, and I
      followed him out to the kitchen as quickly and quietly as he could have
      wished. Such a kitchen!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham opened the door&mdash;which was locked&mdash;just as a
      buggy containing two men drove into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a tragic tone. I understood that something
      dreadful must have happened, but I did not care, since, as I fondly
      supposed, it did not concern me. I pushed out past Alexander Abraham&mdash;who
      was looking as guilty as if he had been caught burglarizing&mdash;and came
      face to face with the man who had sprung from the buggy. It was old Dr.
      Blair, from Carmody, and he was looking at me as if he had found me
      shoplifting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Peter,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;I am VERY sorry to see you here&mdash;very
      sorry indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I admit that this exasperated me. Besides, no man on earth, not even my
      own family doctor, has any right to &ldquo;My dear Peter&rdquo; me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no loud call for sorrow, doctor,&rdquo; I said loftily. &ldquo;If a woman,
      forty-eight years of age, a member of the Presbyterian church in good and
      regular standing, cannot call upon one of her Sunday School scholars
      without wrecking all the proprieties, how old must she be before she can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor did not answer my question. Instead, he looked reproachfully at
      Alexander Abraham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this how you keep your word, Mr. Bennett?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought that
      you promised me that you would not let anyone into the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t let her in,&rdquo; growled Mr. Bennett. &ldquo;Good heavens, man, she
      climbed in at an upstairs window, despite the presence on my grounds of a
      policeman and a dog! What is to be done with a woman like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand what all this means,&rdquo; I said addressing myself to the
      doctor and ignoring Alexander Abraham entirely, &ldquo;but if my presence here
      is so extremely inconvenient to all concerned, you can soon be relieved of
      it. I am going at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, my dear Peter,&rdquo; said the doctor impressively, &ldquo;but that
      is just what I cannot allow you to do. This house is under quarantine for
      smallpox. You will have to stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smallpox! For the first and last time in my life, I openly lost my temper
      with a man. I wheeled furiously upon Alexander Abraham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you!&rdquo; he said, glaring at me. &ldquo;When I first saw you it was too late
      to tell you. I thought the kindest thing I could do was to hold my tongue
      and let you get away in happy ignorance. This will teach you to take a
      man&rsquo;s house by storm, madam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now, don&rsquo;t quarrel, my good people,&rdquo; interposed the doctor seriously&mdash;but
      I saw a twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to spend some time together under
      the same roof and you won&rsquo;t improve the situation by disagreeing. You see,
      Peter, it was this way. Mr. Bennett was in town yesterday&mdash;where, as
      you are aware, there is a bad outbreak of smallpox&mdash;and took dinner
      in a boarding-house where one of the maids was ill. Last night she
      developed unmistakable symptoms of smallpox. The Board of Health at once
      got after all the people who were in the house yesterday, so far as they
      could locate them, and put them under quarantine. I came down here this
      morning and explained the matter to Mr. Bennett. I brought Jeremiah
      Jeffries to guard the front of the house and Mr. Bennett gave me his word
      of honour that he would not let anyone in by the back way while I went to
      get another policeman and make all the necessary arrangements. I have
      brought Thomas Wright and have secured the services of another man to
      attend to Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s barn work and bring provisions to the house. Jacob
      Green and Cleophas Lee will watch at night. I don&rsquo;t think there is much
      danger of Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s taking the smallpox, but until we are sure you
      must remain here, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While listening to the doctor I had been thinking. It was the most
      distressing predicament I had ever got into in my life, but there was no
      sense in making it worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, doctor,&rdquo; I said calmly. &ldquo;Yes, I was vaccinated a month ago,
      when the news of the smallpox first came. When you go back through Avonlea
      kindly go to Sarah Pye and ask her to live in my house during my absence
      and look after things, especially the cats. Tell her to give them new milk
      twice a day and a square inch of butter apiece once a week. Get her to put
      my two dark print wrappers, some aprons, and some changes of underclothing
      in my third best valise and have it sent down to me. My pony is tied out
      there to the fence. Please take him home. That is all, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; said Alexander Abraham grumpily. &ldquo;Send that cat home,
      too. I won&rsquo;t have a cat around the place&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather have smallpox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked Alexander Abraham over gradually, in a way I have, beginning at
      his feet and traveling up to his head. I took my time over it; and then I
      said, very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have both. Anyway, you&rsquo;ll have to have William Adolphus. He is
      under quarantine as well as you and I. Do you suppose I am going to have
      my cat ranging at large through Avonlea, scattering smallpox germs among
      innocent people? I&rsquo;ll have to put up with that dog of yours. You will have
      to endure William Adolphus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham groaned, but I could see that the way I had looked him
      over had chastened him considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor drove away, and I went into the house, not choosing to linger
      outside and be grinned at by Thomas Wright. I hung my coat up in the hall
      and laid my bonnet carefully on the sitting-room table, having first
      dusted a clean place for it with my handkerchief. I longed to fall upon
      that house at once and clean it up, but I had to wait until the doctor
      came back with my wrapper. I could not clean house in my new suit and a
      silk shirtwaist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham was sitting on a chair looking at me. Presently he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am NOT curious&mdash;but will you kindly tell me why the doctor called
      you Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because that is my name, I suppose,&rdquo; I answered, shaking up a cushion for
      William Adolphus and thereby disturbing the dust of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham coughed gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that&mdash;ahem!&mdash;rather a peculiar name for a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; I said, wondering how much soap, if any, there was in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am NOT curious,&rdquo; said Alexander Abraham, &ldquo;but would you mind telling me
      how you came to be called Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had been a boy my parents intended to call me Peter in honour of a
      rich uncle. When I&mdash;fortunately&mdash;turned out to be a girl my
      mother insisted that I should be called Angelina. They gave me both names
      and called me Angelina, but as soon as I grew old enough I decided to be
      called Peter. It was bad enough, but not so bad as Angelina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say it was more appropriate,&rdquo; said Alexander Abraham, intending,
      as I perceived, to be disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; I agreed calmly. &ldquo;My last name is MacPherson, and I live in
      Avonlea. As you are NOT curious, that will be all the information you will
      need about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Alexander Abraham looked as if a light had broken in on him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      heard of you. You&mdash;ah&mdash;pretend to dislike men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretend! Goodness only knows what would have happened to Alexander Abraham
      just then if a diversion had not taken place. But the door opened and a
      dog came in&mdash;THE dog. I suppose he had got tired waiting under the
      cherry tree for William Adolphus and me to come down. He was even uglier
      indoors than out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Riley, Mr. Riley, see what you have let me in for,&rdquo; said
      Alexander Abraham reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Riley&mdash;since that was the brute&rsquo;s name&mdash;paid no
      attention to Alexander Abraham. He had caught sight of William Adolphus
      curled up on the cushion, and he started across the room to investigate
      him. William Adolphus sat up and began to take notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call off that dog,&rdquo; I said warningly to Alexander Abraham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him off yourself,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve brought that cat here
      you can protect him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t for William Adolphus&rsquo; sake I spoke,&rdquo; I said pleasantly.
      &ldquo;William Adolphus can protect himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Adolphus could and did. He humped his back, flattened his ears,
      swore once, and then made a flying leap for Mr. Riley. William Adolphus
      landed squarely on Mr. Riley&rsquo;s brindled back and promptly took fast hold,
      spitting and clawing and caterwauling.
    </p>
    <p>
      You never saw a more astonished dog than Mr. Riley. With a yell of terror
      he bolted out to the kitchen, out of the kitchen into the hall, through
      the hall into the room, and so into the kitchen and round again. With each
      circuit he went faster and faster, until he looked like a brindled streak
      with a dash of black and white on top. Such a racket and commotion I never
      heard, and I laughed until the tears came into my eyes. Mr. Riley flew
      around and around, and William Adolphus held on grimly and clawed.
      Alexander Abraham turned purple with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman, call off that infernal cat before he kills my dog,&rdquo; he shouted
      above the din of yelps and yowls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he won&rsquo;t kill him,&rdquo; I said reassuringly, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s going too fast to
      hear me if I did call him. If you can stop the dog, Mr. Bennett, I&rsquo;ll
      guarantee to make William Adolphus listen to reason, but there&rsquo;s no use
      trying to argue with a lightning flash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham made a frantic lunge at the brindled streak as it
      whirled past him, with the result that he overbalanced himself and went
      sprawling on the floor with a crash. I ran to help him up, which only
      seemed to enrage him further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he spluttered viciously, &ldquo;I wish you and your fiend of a cat were
      in&mdash;in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Avonlea,&rdquo; I finished quickly, to save Alexander Abraham from
      committing profanity. &ldquo;So do I, Mr. Bennett, with all my heart. But since
      we are not, let us make the best of it like sensible people. And in future
      you will kindly remember that my name is Miss MacPherson, NOT Woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this the end came and I was thankful, for the noise those two animals
      made was so terrific that I expected the policeman would be rushing in,
      smallpox or no smallpox, to see if Alexander Abraham and I were trying to
      murder each other. Mr. Riley suddenly veered in his mad career and bolted
      into a dark corner between the stove and the wood-box, William Adolphus
      let go just in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There never was any more trouble with Mr. Riley after that. A meeker, more
      thoroughly chastened dog you could not find. William Adolphus had the best
      of it and he kept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that things had calmed down and that it was five o&rsquo;clock I decided
      to get tea. I told Alexander Abraham that I would prepare it, if he would
      show me where the eatables were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Alexander Abraham. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the habit of
      getting my own tea for twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay. But you haven&rsquo;t been in the habit of getting mine,&rdquo; I said
      firmly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t eat anything you cooked if I starved to death. If you
      want some occupation, you&rsquo;d better get some salve and anoint the scratches
      on that poor dog&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham said something that I prudently did not hear. Seeing
      that he had no information to hand out I went on an exploring expedition
      into the pantry. The place was awful beyond description, and for the first
      time a vague sentiment of pity for Alexander Abraham glimmered in my
      breast. When a man had to live in such surroundings the wonder was, not
      that he hated women, but that he didn&rsquo;t hate the whole human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I got up a supper somehow. I am noted for getting up suppers. The
      bread was from the Carmody bakery and I made good tea and excellent toast;
      besides, I found a can of peaches in the pantry which, as they were
      bought, I wasn&rsquo;t afraid to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      That tea and toast mellowed Alexander Abraham in spite of himself. He ate
      the last crust, and didn&rsquo;t growl when I gave William Adolphus all the
      cream that was left. Mr. Riley did not seem to want anything. He had no
      appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the doctor&rsquo;s boy had arrived with my valise. Alexander
      Abraham gave me quite civilly to understand that there was a spare room
      across the hall and that I might take possession of it. I went to it and
      put on a wrapper. There was a set of fine furniture in the room, and a
      comfortable bed. But the dust! William Adolphus had followed me in and his
      paws left marks everywhere he walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I said briskly, returning to the kitchen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to clean up
      and I shall begin with this kitchen. You&rsquo;d better betake yourself to the
      sitting-room, Mr. Bennett, so as to be out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham glared at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to have my house meddled with,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;It suits me.
      If you don&rsquo;t like it you can leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. That is just the trouble,&rdquo; I said pleasantly. &ldquo;If I could
      leave it I shouldn&rsquo;t be here for a minute. Since I can&rsquo;t, it simply has to
      be cleaned. I can tolerate men and dogs when I am compelled to, but I
      cannot and will not tolerate dirt and disorder. Go into the sitting-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham went. As he closed the door, I heard him say, in
      capitals, &ldquo;WHAT AN AWFUL WOMAN!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I cleared that kitchen and the pantry adjoining. It was ten o&rsquo;clock when I
      got through, and Alexander Abraham had gone to bed without deigning
      further speech. I locked Mr. Riley in one room and William Adolphus in
      another and went to bed, too. I had never felt so dead tired in my life
      before. It had been a hard day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I got up bright and early the next morning and got a tiptop breakfast,
      which Alexander Abraham condescended to eat. When the provision man came
      into the yard I called to him from the window to bring me a box of soap in
      the afternoon, and then I tackled the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took me the best part of a week to get that house in order, but I did
      it thoroughly. I am noted for doing things thoroughly. At the end of the
      time it was clean from garret to cellar. Alexander Abraham made no
      comments on my operations, though he groaned loud and often, and said
      caustic things to poor Mr. Riley, who hadn&rsquo;t the spirit to answer back
      after his drubbing by William Adolphus. I made allowances for Alexander
      Abraham because his vaccination had taken and his arm was real sore; and I
      cooked elegant meals, not having much else to do, once I had got things
      scoured up. The house was full of provisions&mdash;Alexander Abraham
      wasn&rsquo;t mean about such things, I will say that for him. Altogether, I was
      more comfortable than I had expected to be. When Alexander Abraham
      wouldn&rsquo;t talk I let him alone; and when he would I just said as sarcastic
      things as he did, only I said them smiling and pleasant. I could see he
      had a wholesome awe for me. But now and then he seemed to forget his
      disposition and talked like a human being. We had one or two real
      interesting conversations. Alexander Abraham was an intelligent man,
      though he had got terribly warped. I told him once I thought he must have
      been nice when he was a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he astonished me by appearing at the dinner table with his hair
      brushed and a white collar on. We had a tiptop dinner that day, and I had
      made a pudding that was far too good for a woman hater. When Alexander
      Abraham had disposed of two large platefuls of it, he sighed and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can certainly cook. It&rsquo;s a pity you are such a detestable crank in
      other respects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of convenient being a crank,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;People are careful how
      they meddle with you. Haven&rsquo;t you found that out in your own experience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am NOT a crank,&rdquo; growled Alexander Abraham resentfully. &ldquo;All I ask is
      to be let alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very crankiest kind of crank,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A person who wants to
      be let alone flies in the face of Providence, who decreed that folks for
      their own good were not to be let alone. But cheer up, Mr. Bennett. The
      quarantine will be up on Tuesday and then you&rsquo;ll certainly be let alone
      for the rest of your natural life, as far as William Adolphus and I are
      concerned. You may then return to your wallowing in the mire and be as
      dirty and comfortable as of yore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham growled again. The prospect didn&rsquo;t seem to cheer him up
      as much as I should have expected. Then he did an amazing thing. He poured
      some cream into a saucer and set it down before William Adolphus. William
      Adolphus lapped it up, keeping one eye on Alexander Abraham lest the
      latter should change his mind. Not to be outdone, I handed Mr. Riley a
      bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Alexander Abraham nor I had worried much about the smallpox. We
      didn&rsquo;t believe he would take it, for he hadn&rsquo;t even seen the girl who was
      sick. But the very next morning I heard him calling me from the upstairs
      landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss MacPherson,&rdquo; he said in a voice so uncommonly mild that it gave me
      an uncanny feeling, &ldquo;what are the symptoms of smallpox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chills and flushes, pain in the limbs and back, nausea and vomiting,&rdquo; I
      answered promptly, for I had been reading them up in a patent medicine
      almanac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got them all,&rdquo; said Alexander Abraham hollowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t feel as much scared as I should have expected. After enduring a
      woman hater and a brindled dog and the early disorder of that house&mdash;and
      coming off best with all three&mdash;smallpox seemed rather insignificant.
      I went to the window and called to Thomas Wright to send for the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came down from Alexander Abraham&rsquo;s room looking grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to pronounce on the disease yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is no
      certainty until the eruption appears. But, of course, there is every
      likelihood that it is the smallpox. It is very unfortunate. I am afraid
      that it will be difficult to get a nurse. All the nurses in town who will
      take smallpox cases are overbusy now, for the epidemic is still raging
      there. However, I&rsquo;ll go into town to-night and do my best. Meanwhile, at
      present, you must not go near him, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wasn&rsquo;t going to take orders from any man, and as soon as the doctor had
      gone I marched straight up to Alexander Abraham&rsquo;s room with some dinner
      for him on a tray. There was a lemon cream I thought he could eat even if
      he had the smallpox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t come near me,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;You are risking your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to see a fellow creature starve to death, even if he is a
      man,&rdquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst of it all,&rdquo; groaned Alexander Abraham, between mouthfuls of
      lemon cream, &ldquo;is that the doctor says I&rsquo;ve got to have a nurse. I&rsquo;ve got
      so kind of used to you being in the house that I don&rsquo;t mind you, but the
      thought of another woman coming here is too much. Did you give my poor dog
      anything to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has had a better dinner than many a Christian,&rdquo; I said severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham need not have worried about another woman coming in. The
      doctor came back that night with care on his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is to be done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get a soul to come
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> shall nurse Mr. Bennett,&rdquo; I said with dignity. &ldquo;It is my duty
      and I never shirk my duty. I am noted for that. He is a man, and he has
      smallpox, and he keeps a vile dog; but I am not going to see him die for
      lack of care for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good soul, Peter,&rdquo; said the doctor, looking relieved, manlike,
      as soon as he found a woman to shoulder the responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nursed Alexander Abraham through the smallpox, and I didn&rsquo;t mind it
      much. He was much more amiable sick than well, and he had the disease in a
      very mild form. Below stairs I reigned supreme and Mr. Riley and William
      Adolphus lay down together like the lion and the lamb. I fed Mr. Riley
      regularly, and once, seeing him looking lonesome, I patted him gingerly.
      It was nicer than I thought it would be. Mr. Riley lifted his head and
      looked at me with an expression in his eyes which cured me of wondering
      why on earth Alexander Abraham was so fond of the beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alexander Abraham was able to sit up, he began to make up for the
      time he&rsquo;d lost being pleasant. Anything more sarcastic than that man in
      his convalescence you couldn&rsquo;t imagine. I just laughed at him, having
      found out that that could be depended on to irritate him. To irritate him
      still further I cleaned the house all over again. But what vexed him most
      of all was that Mr. Riley took to following me about and wagging what he
      had of a tail at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t enough that you should come into my peaceful home and turn it
      upside down, but you have to alienate the affections of my dog,&rdquo;
       complained Alexander Abraham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get fond of you again when I go home,&rdquo; I said comfortingly. &ldquo;Dogs
      aren&rsquo;t very particular that way. What they want is bones. Cats now, they
      love disinterestedly. William Adolphus has never swerved in his allegiance
      to me, although you do give him cream in the pantry on the sly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham looked foolish. He hadn&rsquo;t thought I knew that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t take the smallpox and in another week the doctor came out and
      sent the policeman home. I was disinfected and William Adolphus was
      fumigated, and then we were free to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Bennett,&rdquo; I said, offering to shake hands in a forgiving
      spirit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt that you are glad to be rid of me, but you are no
      gladder than I am to go. I suppose this house will be dirtier than ever in
      a month&rsquo;s time, and Mr. Riley will have discarded the little polish his
      manners have taken on. Reformation with men and dogs never goes very
      deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this Parthian shaft I walked out of the house, supposing that I had
      seen the last of it and Alexander Abraham.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad to get back home, of course; but it did seem queer and
      lonesome. The cats hardly knew me, and William Adolphus roamed about
      forlornly and appeared to feel like an exile. I didn&rsquo;t take as much
      pleasure in cooking as usual, for it seemed kind of foolish to be fussing
      over oneself. The sight of a bone made me think of poor Mr. Riley. The
      neighbours avoided me pointedly, for they couldn&rsquo;t get rid of the fear
      that I might erupt into smallpox at any moment. My Sunday School class had
      been given to another woman, and altogether I felt as if I didn&rsquo;t belong
      anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had existed like this for a fortnight when Alexander Abraham suddenly
      appeared. He walked in one evening at dusk, but at first sight I didn&rsquo;t
      know him he was so spruced and barbered up. But William Adolphus knew him.
      Will you believe it, William Adolphus, my own William Adolphus, rubbed up
      against that man&rsquo;s trouser leg with an undisguised purr of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to come, Angelina,&rdquo; said Alexander Abraham. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand it
      any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Peter,&rdquo; I said coldly, although I was feeling ridiculously
      glad about something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Alexander Abraham stubbornly. &ldquo;It is Angelina for me, and
      always will be. I shall never call you Peter. Angelina just suits you
      exactly; and Angelina Bennett would suit you still better. You must come
      back, Angelina. Mr. Riley is moping for you, and I can&rsquo;t get along without
      somebody to appreciate my sarcasms, now that you have accustomed me to the
      luxury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the other five cats?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Abraham sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;ll have to come too,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;though no doubt they&rsquo;ll
      chase poor Mr. Riley clean off the premises. But I can live without him,
      and I can&rsquo;t without you. How soon can you be ready to marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said that I was going to marry you at all, have I?&rdquo; I said
      tartly, just to be consistent. For I wasn&rsquo;t feeling tart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you will, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Alexander Abraham anxiously. &ldquo;Because
      if you won&rsquo;t, I wish you&rsquo;d let me die of the smallpox. Do, dear Angelina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To think that a man should dare to call me his &ldquo;dear Angelina!&rdquo; And to
      think that I shouldn&rsquo;t mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where I go, William Adolphus goes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I shall give away the
      other five cats for&mdash;for the sake of Mr. Riley.&rdquo;

      IX. Pa Sloane&rsquo;s Purchase
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess the molasses is getting low, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Pa Sloane
      insinuatingly. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;d better drive up to Carmody this afternoon and
      get some more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good half-gallon of molasses in the jug yet,&rdquo; said ma Sloane
      ruthlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so? Well, I noticed the kerosene demijohn wasn&rsquo;t very hefty the last
      time I filled the can. Reckon it needs replenishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have kerosene enough to do for a fortnight yet.&rdquo; Ma continued to eat
      her dinner with an impassive face, but a twinkle made itself apparent in
      her eye. Lest Pa should see it, and feel encouraged thereby, she looked
      immovably at her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pa Sloane sighed. His invention was giving out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I hear you say day before yesterday that you were out of nutmegs?&rdquo;
       he queried, after a few moments&rsquo; severe reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a supply of them from the egg-pedlar yesterday,&rdquo; responded Ma, by a
      great effort preventing the twinkle from spreading over her entire face.
      She wondered if this third failure would squelch Pa. But Pa was not to be
      squelched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; he said, brightening up under the influence of a sudden
      saving inspiration. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go up to get the sorrel mare shod. So,
      if you&rsquo;ve any little errands you want done at the store, Ma, just make a
      memo of them while I hitch up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matter of shoeing the sorrel mare was beyond Ma&rsquo;s province, although
      she had her own suspicions about the sorrel mare&rsquo;s need of shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you give up beating about the bush, Pa?&rdquo; she demanded, with
      contemptuous pity. &ldquo;You might as well own up what&rsquo;s taking you to Carmody.
      <i>I</i> can see through your design. You want to get away to the Garland
      auction. That is what is troubling you, Pa Sloane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno but what I might step over, seeing it&rsquo;s so handy. But the sorrel
      mare really does need shoeing, Ma,&rdquo; protested Pa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always something needing to be done if it&rsquo;s convenient,&rdquo; retorted
      Ma. &ldquo;Your mania for auctions will be the ruin of you yet, Pa. A man of
      fifty-five ought to have grown out of such a hankering. But the older you
      get the worse you get. Anyway, if <i>I</i> wanted to go to auctions, I&rsquo;d
      select them as was something like, and not waste my time on little
      one-horse affairs like this of Garland&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One might pick up something real cheap at Garland&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Pa
      defensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are not going to pick up anything, cheap or otherwise, Pa
      Sloane, because I&rsquo;m going with you to see that you don&rsquo;t. I know I can&rsquo;t
      stop you from going. I might as well try to stop the wind from blowing.
      But I shall go, too, out of self-defence. This house is so full now of old
      clutter and truck that you&rsquo;ve brought home from auctions that I feel as if
      I was made up out of pieces and left overs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pa Sloane sighed again. It was not exhilarating to attend an auction with
      Ma. She would never let him bid on anything. But he realized that Ma&rsquo;s
      mind was made up beyond the power of mortal man&rsquo;s persuasion to alter it,
      so he went out to hitch up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pa Sloane&rsquo;s dissipation was going to auctions and buying things that
      nobody else would buy. Ma Sloane&rsquo;s patient endeavours of over thirty years
      had been able to effect only a partial reform. Sometimes Pa heroically
      refrained from going to an auction for six months at a time; then he would
      break out worse than ever, go to all that took place for miles around, and
      come home with a wagonful of misfits. His last exploit had been to bid on
      an old dasher churn for five dollars&mdash;the boys &ldquo;ran things up&rdquo; on Pa
      Sloane for the fun of it&mdash;and bring it home to outraged Ma, who had
      made her butter for fifteen years in the very latest, most up-to-date
      barrel churn. To add insult to injury this was the second dasher churn Pa
      had bought at auction. That settled it. Ma decreed that henceforth she
      would chaperon Pa when he went to auctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was the day of Pa&rsquo;s good angel. When he drove up to the door
      where Ma was waiting, a breathless, hatless imp of ten flew into the yard,
      and hurled himself between Ma and the wagon-step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Sloane, won&rsquo;t you come over to our house at once?&rdquo; he gasped.
      &ldquo;The baby, he&rsquo;s got colic, and ma&rsquo;s just wild, and he&rsquo;s all black in the
      face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ma went, feeling that the stars in their courses fought against a woman
      who was trying to do her duty by her husband. But first she admonished Pa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to let you go alone. But I charge you, Pa, not to bid on
      anything&mdash;on ANYTHING, do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pa heard and promised to heed, with every intention of keeping his
      promise. Then he drove away joyfully. On any other occasion Ma would have
      been a welcome companion. But she certainly spoiled the flavour of an
      auction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pa arrived at the Carmody store, he saw that the little yard of the
      Garland place below the hill was already full of people. The auction had
      evidently begun; so, not to miss any more of it, Pa hurried down. The
      sorrel mare could wait for her shoes until afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma had been within bounds when she called the Garland auction a &ldquo;one-horse
      affair.&rdquo; It certainly was very paltry, especially when compared to the big
      Donaldson auction of a month ago, which Pa still lived over in happy
      dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace Garland and his wife had been poor. When they died within six weeks
      of each other, one of consumption and one of pneumonia, they left nothing
      but debts and a little furniture. The house had been a rented one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bidding on the various poor articles of household gear put up for sale
      was not brisk, but had an element of resigned determination. Carmody
      people knew that these things had to be sold to pay the debts, and they
      could not be sold unless they were bought. Still, it was a very tame
      affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman came out of the house carrying a baby of about eighteen months in
      her arms, and sat down on the bench beneath the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Marthy Blair with the Garland Baby,&rdquo; said Robert Lawson to Pa.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what&rsquo;s to become of that poor young one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t there any of the father&rsquo;s or mother&rsquo;s folks to take him?&rdquo; asked Pa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Horace had no relatives that anybody ever heard of. Mrs. Horace had a
      brother; but he went to Manitoba years ago, and nobody knows where he is
      now. Somebody&rsquo;ll have to take the baby and nobody seems anxious to. I&rsquo;ve
      got eight myself, or I&rsquo;d think about it. He&rsquo;s a fine little chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pa, with Ma&rsquo;s parting admonition ringing in his ears, did not bid on
      anything, although it will never be known how great was the heroic
      self-restraint he put on himself, until just at the last, when he did bid
      on a collection of flower-pots, thinking he might indulge himself to that
      small extent. But Josiah Sloane had been commissioned by his wife to bring
      those flower-pots home to her; so Pa lost them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the auctioneer, wiping his face, for the day was
      very warm for October.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more unless we sell the baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A laugh went through the crowd. The sale had been a dull affair, and they
      were ready for some fun. Someone called out, &ldquo;Put him up, Jacob.&rdquo; The joke
      found favour and the call was repeated hilariously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob Blair took little Teddy Garland out of Martha&rsquo;s arms and stood him
      up on the table by the door, steadying the small chap with one big brown
      hand. The baby had a mop of yellow curls, and a pink and white face, and
      big blue eyes. He laughed out at the men before him and waved his hands in
      delight. Pa Sloane thought he had never seen so pretty a baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a baby for sale,&rdquo; shouted the auctioneer. &ldquo;A genuine article,
      pretty near as good as brand-new. A real live baby, warranted to walk and
      talk a little. Who bids? A dollar? Did I hear anyone mean enough to bid a
      dollar? No, sir, babies don&rsquo;t come as cheap as that, especially the
      curly-headed brand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd laughed again. Pa Sloane, by way of keeping on the joke, cried,
      &ldquo;Four dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody looked at him. The impression flashed through the crowd that Pa
      was in earnest, and meant thus to signify his intention of giving the baby
      a home. He was well-to-do, and his only son was grown up and married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six,&rdquo; cried out John Clarke from the other side of the yard. John Clarke
      lived at White Sands and he and his wife were childless.
    </p>
    <p>
      That bid of John Clarke&rsquo;s was Pa&rsquo;s undoing. Pa Sloane could not have an
      enemy; but a rival he had, and that rival was John Clarke. Everywhere at
      auctions John Clarke was wont to bid against Pa. At the last auction he
      had outbid Pa in everything, not having the fear of his wife before his
      eyes. Pa&rsquo;s fighting blood was up in a moment; he forgot Ma Sloane; he
      forgot what he was bidding for; he forgot everything except a
      determination that John Clarke should not be victor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten,&rdquo; he called shrilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen,&rdquo; shouted Clarke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty,&rdquo; vociferated Pa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five,&rdquo; bellowed Clarke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty,&rdquo; shrieked Pa. He nearly bust a blood-vessel in his shrieking, but
      he had won. Clarke turned off with a laugh and a shrug, and the baby was
      knocked down to Pa Sloane by the auctioneer, who had meanwhile been
      keeping the crowd in roars of laughter by a quick fire of witticisms.
      There had not been such fun at an auction in Carmody for many a long day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pa Sloane came, or was pushed, forward. The baby was put into his arms; he
      realized that he was expected to keep it, and he was too dazed to refuse;
      besides, his heart went out to the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The auctioneer looked doubtfully at the money which Pa laid mutely down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose that part was only a joke,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said Robert Lawson. &ldquo;All the money won&rsquo;t be too much to
      pay the debts. There&rsquo;s a doctor&rsquo;s bill, and this will just about pay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pa Sloane drove back home, with the sorrel mare still unshod, the baby,
      and the baby&rsquo;s meager bundle of clothes. The baby did not trouble him
      much; it had become well used to strangers in the past two months, and
      promptly fell asleep on his arm; but Pa Sloane did not enjoy that drive;
      at the end of it he mentally saw Ma Sloane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma was there, too, waiting for him on the back door-step as he drove into
      the yard at sunset. Her face, when she saw the baby, expressed the last
      degree of amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pa Sloane,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;whose is that young one, and where did you get
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;bought it at the auction, Ma,&rdquo; said Pa feebly. Then he
      waited for the explosion. None came. This last exploit of Pa&rsquo;s was too
      much for Ma.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a gasp she snatched the baby from Pa&rsquo;s arms, and ordered him to go
      out and put the mare in. When Pa returned to the kitchen Ma had set the
      baby on the sofa, fenced him around with chairs so that he couldn&rsquo;t fall
      off and given him a molassed cooky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Pa Sloane, you can explain,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pa explained. Ma listened in grim silence until he had finished. Then she
      said sternly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you reckon we&rsquo;re going to keep this baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;dunno,&rdquo; said Pa. And he didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re NOT. I brought up one boy and that&rsquo;s enough. I don&rsquo;t
      calculate to be pestered with any more. I never was much struck on
      children <i>as</i> children, anyhow. You say that Mary Garland had a
      brother out in Manitoba? Well, we shall just write to him and tell him
      he&rsquo;s got to look out for his nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you do that, Ma, when nobody knows his address?&rdquo; objected Pa,
      with a wistful look at that delicious, laughing baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out his address if I have to advertise in the papers for him,&rdquo;
       retorted Ma. &ldquo;As for you, Pa Sloane, you&rsquo;re not fit to be out of a lunatic
      asylum. The next auction you&rsquo;ll be buying a wife, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pa, quite crushed by Ma&rsquo;s sarcasm, pulled his chair in to supper. Ma
      picked up the baby and sat down at the head of the table. Little Teddy
      laughed and pinched her face&mdash;Ma&rsquo;s face! Ma looked very grim, but she
      fed him his supper as skilfully as if it had not been thirty years since
      she had done such a thing. But then, the woman who once learns the mother
      knack never forgets it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea Ma despatched Pa over to William Alexander&rsquo;s to borrow a high
      chair. When Pa returned in the twilight, the baby was fenced in on the
      sofa again, and Ma was stepping briskly about the garret. She was bringing
      down the little cot bed her own boy had once occupied, and setting it up
      in their room for Teddy. Then she undressed the baby and rocked him to
      sleep, crooning an old lullaby over him. Pa Sloane sat quietly and
      listened, with very sweet memories of the long ago, when he and Ma had
      been young and proud, and the bewhiskered William Alexander had been a
      curly-headed little fellow like this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma was not driven to advertising for Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s brother. That
      personage saw the notice of his sister&rsquo;s death in a home paper and wrote
      to the Carmody postmaster for full information. The letter was referred to
      Ma and Ma answered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote that they had taken in the baby, pending further arrangements,
      but had no intention of keeping it; and she calmly demanded of its uncle
      what was to be done with it. Then she sealed and addressed the letter with
      an unfaltering hand; but, when it was done, she looked across the table at
      Pa Sloane, who was sitting in the armchair with the baby on his knee. They
      were having a royal good time together. Pa had always been dreadfully
      foolish about babies. He looked ten years younger. Ma&rsquo;s keen eyes softened
      a little as she watched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prompt answer came to her letter. Teddy&rsquo;s uncle wrote that he had six
      children of his own, but was nevertheless willing and glad to give his
      little nephew a home. But he could not come after him. Josiah Spencer, of
      White Sands, was going out to Manitoba in the spring. If Mr. and Mrs.
      Sloane could only keep the baby till then he could be sent out with the
      Spencers. Perhaps they would see a chance sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no chance sooner,&rdquo; said Pa Sloane in a tone of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, worse luck!&rdquo; retorted Ma crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter passed by. Little Teddy grew and throve, and Pa Sloane
      worshipped him. Ma was very good to him, too, and Teddy was just as fond
      of her as of Pa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, as the spring drew near, Pa became depressed. Sometimes he
      sighed heavily, especially when he heard casual references to the Josiah
      Spencer emigration.
    </p>
    <p>
      One warm afternoon in early May Josiah Spencer arrived. He found Ma
      knitting placidly in the kitchen, while Pa nodded over his newspaper and
      the baby played with the cat on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good afternoon, Mrs. Sloane,&rdquo; said Josiah with a flourish. &ldquo;I just
      dropped in to see about this young man here. We are going to leave next
      Wednesday; so you&rsquo;d better send him down to our place Monday or Tuesday,
      so that he can get used to us, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ma,&rdquo; began Pa, rising imploringly to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma transfixed him with her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Pa,&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappy Pa sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ma glared at the smiling Josiah, who instantly felt as guilty as if
      he had been caught stealing sheep red-handed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are much obliged to you, Mr. Spencer,&rdquo; said Ma icily, &ldquo;but this baby
      is OURS. We bought him, and we paid for him. A bargain is a bargain. When
      I pay cash down for babies, I propose to get my money&rsquo;s worth. We are
      going to keep this baby in spite of any number of uncles in Manitoba. Have
      I made this sufficiently clear to your understanding, Mr. Spencer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; stammered the unfortunate man, feeling guiltier
      than ever, &ldquo;but I thought you didn&rsquo;t want him&mdash;I thought you&rsquo;d
      written to his uncle&mdash;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really wouldn&rsquo;t think quite so much if I were you,&rdquo; said Ma kindly. &ldquo;It
      must be hard on you. Won&rsquo;t you stay and have tea with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, no, Josiah would not stay. He was thankful to make his escape with
      such rags of self-respect as remained to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pa Sloane arose and came around to Ma&rsquo;s chair. He laid a trembling hand on
      her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma, you&rsquo;re a good woman,&rdquo; he said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go &lsquo;long, Pa,&rdquo; said Ma.

    <h2>
      X. The Courting of Prissy Strong
    </h2>
    <p>
      I WASN&rsquo;T able to go to prayer meeting that evening because I had neuralgia
      in my face; but Thomas went, and the minute he came home I knew by the
      twinkle in his eye that he had some news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you s&rsquo;pose Stephen Clark went home with from meeting to-night?&rdquo; he
      said, chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane Miranda Blair,&rdquo; I said promptly. Stephen Clark&rsquo;s wife had been dead
      for two years and he hadn&rsquo;t taken much notice of anybody, so far as was
      known. But Carmody had Jane Miranda all ready for him, and really I don&rsquo;t
      know why she didn&rsquo;t suit him, except for the reason that a man never does
      what he is expected to do when it comes to marrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas chuckled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong. He stepped up to Prissy Strong and walked off with her. Cold soup
      warmed over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prissy Strong!&rdquo; I just held up my hands. Then I laughed. &ldquo;He needn&rsquo;t try
      for Prissy,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Emmeline nipped that in the bud twenty years ago,
      and she&rsquo;ll do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Em&rsquo;line is an old crank,&rdquo; growled Thomas. He detested Emmeline Strong,
      and always did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s that, all right,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;and that is just the reason she can
      turn poor Prissy any way she likes. You mark my words, she&rsquo;ll put her foot
      right down on this as soon as she finds it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thomas said that I was probably right. I lay awake for a long time after I
      went to bed that night, thinking of Prissy and Stephen. As a general rule,
      I don&rsquo;t concern my head about other people&rsquo;s affairs, but Prissy was such
      a helpless creature I couldn&rsquo;t get her off my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty years ago Stephen Clark had tried to go with Prissy Strong. That
      was pretty soon after Prissy&rsquo;s father had died. She and Emmeline were
      living alone together. Emmeline was thirty, ten years older than Prissy,
      and if ever there were two sisters totally different from each other in
      every way, those two were Emmeline and Prissy Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emmeline took after her father; she was big and dark and homely, and she
      was the most domineering creature that ever stepped on shoe leather. She
      simply ruled poor Prissy with a rod of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prissy herself was a pretty girl&mdash;at least most people thought so. I
      can&rsquo;t honestly say I ever admired her style much myself. I like something
      with more vim and snap to it. Prissy was slim and pink, with soft,
      appealing blue eyes, and pale gold hair all clinging in baby rings around
      her face. She was just as meek and timid as she looked and there wasn&rsquo;t a
      bit of harm in her. I always liked Prissy, even if I didn&rsquo;t admire her
      looks as much as some people did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, it was plain her style suited Stephen Clark. He began to drive
      her, and there wasn&rsquo;t a speck of doubt that Prissy liked him. Then
      Emmeline just put a stopper on the affair. It was pure cantankerousness in
      her. Stephen was a good match and nothing could be said against him. But
      Emmeline was just determined that Prissy shouldn&rsquo;t marry. She couldn&rsquo;t get
      married herself, and she was sore enough about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, if Prissy had had a spark of spirit she wouldn&rsquo;t have given in.
      But she hadn&rsquo;t a mite; I believe she would have cut off her nose if
      Emmeline had ordered her to do it. She was just her mother over again. If
      ever a girl belied her name, Prissy Strong did. There wasn&rsquo;t anything
      strong about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, when prayer meeting came out, Stephen stepped up to Prissy as
      usual and asked if he might see her home. Thomas and I were just behind&mdash;we
      weren&rsquo;t married ourselves then&mdash;and we heard it all. Prissy gave one
      scared, appealing look at Emmeline and then said, &ldquo;No, thank you, not
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephen just turned on his heel and went. He was a high-spirited fellow
      and I knew he would never overlook a public slight like that. If he had
      had as much sense as he ought to have had he would have known that
      Emmeline was at the bottom of it; but he didn&rsquo;t, and he began going to see
      Althea Gillis, and they were married the next year. Althea was a rather
      nice girl, though giddy, and I think she and Stephen were happy enough
      together. In real life things are often like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody ever tried to go with Prissy again. I suppose they were afraid of
      Emmeline. Prissy&rsquo;s beauty soon faded. She was always kind of sweet
      looking, but her bloom went, and she got shyer and limper every year of
      her life. She wouldn&rsquo;t have dared put on her second best dress without
      asking Emmeline&rsquo;s permission. She was real fond of cats and Emmeline
      wouldn&rsquo;t let her keep one. Emmeline even cut the serial out of the
      religious weekly she took before she would give it to Prissy, because she
      didn&rsquo;t believe in reading novels. It used to make me furious to see it
      all. They were my next door neighbours after I married Thomas, and I was
      often in and out. Sometimes I&rsquo;d feel real vexed at Prissy for giving in
      the way she did; but, after all, she couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;she was born
      that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Stephen was going to try his luck again. It certainly did seem
      funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen walked home with Prissy from prayer meeting four nights before
      Emmeline found it out. Emmeline hadn&rsquo;t been going to prayer meeting all
      that summer because she was mad at Mr. Leonard. She had expressed her
      disapproval to him because he had buried old Naomi Clark at the harbour
      &ldquo;just as if she was a Christian,&rdquo; and Mr. Leonard had said something to
      her she couldn&rsquo;t get over for a while. I don&rsquo;t know what it was, but I
      know that when Mr. Leonard WAS roused to rebuke anyone the person so
      rebuked remembered it for a spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once I knew she must have discovered about Stephen and Prissy, for
      Prissy stopped going to prayer meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt real worried about it, someway, and although Thomas said for
      goodness&rsquo; sake not to go poking my fingers into other people&rsquo;s pies, I
      felt as if I ought to do something. Stephen Clark was a good man and
      Prissy would have a beautiful home; and those two little boys of Althea&rsquo;s
      needed a mother if ever boys did. Besides, I knew quite well that Prissy,
      in her secret soul, was hankering to be married. So was Emmeline, too&mdash;but
      nobody wanted to help HER to a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of my meditations was that I asked Stephen down to dinner with
      us from church one day. I had heard a rumour that he was going to see
      Lizzie Pye over at Avonlea, and I knew it was time to be stirring, if
      anything were to be done. If it had been Jane Miranda I don&rsquo;t know that
      I&rsquo;d have bothered; but Lizzie Pye wouldn&rsquo;t have done for a stepmother for
      Althea&rsquo;s boys at all. She was too bad-tempered, and as mean as second
      skimmings besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen came. He seemed dull and moody, and not much inclined to talk.
      After dinner I gave Thomas a hint. I said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to bed and have your nap. I want to talk to Stephen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thomas shrugged his shoulders and went. He probably thought I was brewing
      up lots of trouble for myself, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. As soon as he
      was out of the way I casually remarked to Stephen that I understood that
      he was going to take one of my neighbours away and that I couldn&rsquo;t be
      sorry, though she was an excellent neighbour and I would miss her a great
      deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to miss her much, I reckon,&rdquo; said Stephen grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been told I&rsquo;m not wanted there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised to hear Stephen come out so plump and plain about it, for
      I hadn&rsquo;t expected to get at the root of the matter so easily. Stephen
      wasn&rsquo;t the confidential kind. But it really seemed to be a relief to him
      to talk about it; I never saw a man feeling so sore about anything. He
      told me the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prissy had written him a letter&mdash;he fished it out of his pocket and
      gave it to me to read. It was in Prissy&rsquo;s prim, pretty little writing,
      sure enough, and it just said that his attentions were &ldquo;unwelcome,&rdquo; and
      would he be &ldquo;kind enough to refrain from offering them.&rdquo; Not much wonder
      the poor man went to see Lizzie Pye!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, I&rsquo;m surprised at you for thinking that Prissy Strong wrote that
      letter,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in her handwriting,&rdquo; he said stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. &lsquo;The hand is the hand of Esau, but the voice is the
      voice of Jacob,&rsquo;&rdquo; I said, though I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether the quotation was
      exactly appropriate. &ldquo;Emmeline composed that letter and made Prissy copy
      it out. I know that as well as if I&rsquo;d seen her do it, and you ought to
      have known it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought that I&rsquo;d show Emmeline I could get Prissy in spite of her,&rdquo;
       said Stephen savagely. &ldquo;But if Prissy doesn&rsquo;t want me I&rsquo;m not going to
      force my attentions on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, we talked it over a bit, and in the end I agreed to sound Prissy,
      and find out what she really thought about it. I didn&rsquo;t think it would be
      hard to do; and it wasn&rsquo;t. I went over the very next day because I saw
      Emmeline driving off to the store. I found Prissy alone, sewing carpet
      rags. Emmeline kept her constantly at that&mdash;because Prissy hated it I
      suppose. Prissy was crying when I went in, and in a few minutes I had the
      whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prissy wanted to get married&mdash;and she wanted to get married to
      Stephen&mdash;and Emmeline wouldn&rsquo;t let her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prissy Strong,&rdquo; I said in exasperation, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t the spirit of a
      mouse! Why on earth did you write him such a letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Emmeline made me,&rdquo; said Prissy, as if there couldn&rsquo;t be any appeal
      from that; and I knew there couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;for Prissy. I also knew that if
      Stephen wanted to see Prissy again Emmeline must know nothing of it, and I
      told him so when he came down the next evening&mdash;to borrow a hoe, he
      said. It was a long way to come for a hoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what am I to do?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be any use to write, for it
      would likely fall into Emmeline&rsquo;s hands. She won&rsquo;t let Prissy go anywhere
      alone after this, and how am I to know when the old cat is away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t insult cats,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do. You can
      see the ventilator on our barn from your place, can&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;d be able
      to make out a flag or something tied to it, wouldn&rsquo;t you, through that
      spy-glass of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephen thought he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you take a squint at it every now and then,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Just as soon
      as Emmeline leaves Prissy alone I&rsquo;ll hoist the signal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chance didn&rsquo;t come for a whole fortnight. Then, one evening, I saw
      Emmeline striding over the field below our house. As soon as she was out
      of sight I ran through the birch grove to Prissy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Em&rsquo;line&rsquo;s gone to sit up with Jane Lawson to-night,&rdquo; said Prissy,
      all fluttered and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you put on your muslin dress and fix your hair,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
      home to get Thomas to tie something to that ventilator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But do you think Thomas would do it? Not he. He said he owed something to
      his position as elder in the church. In the end I had to do it myself,
      though I don&rsquo;t like climbing ladders. I tied Thomas&rsquo; long red woollen
      scarf to the ventilator, and prayed that Stephen would see it. He did, for
      in less than an hour he drove down our lane and put his horse in our barn.
      He was all spruced up, and as nervous and excited as a schoolboy. He went
      right over to Prissy, and I began to tuft my new comfort with a clear
      conscience. I shall never know why it suddenly came into my head to go up
      to the garret and make sure that the moths hadn&rsquo;t got into my box of
      blankets; but I always believed that it was a special interposition of
      Providence. I went up and happened to look out of the east window; and
      there I saw Emmeline Strong coming home across our pond field.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just flew down those garret stairs and out through the birches. I burst
      into the Strong kitchen, where Stephen and Prissy were sitting as cozy as
      you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, come quick! Emmeline&rsquo;s nearly here,&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prissy looked out of the window and wrung her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s in the lane now,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get out of the house
      without her seeing him. Oh, Rosanna, what shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I really don&rsquo;t know what would have become of those two people if I hadn&rsquo;t
      been in existence to find ideas for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take Stephen up to the garret and hide him there, Prissy,&rdquo; I said firmly,
      &ldquo;and take him quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prissy took him quick, but she had barely time to get back to the kitchen
      before Emmeline marched in&mdash;mad as a wet hen because somebody had
      been ahead of her offering to sit up with Jane Lawson, and so she lost the
      chance of poking and prying into things while Jane was asleep. The minute
      she clapped eyes on Prissy she suspected something. It wasn&rsquo;t any wonder,
      for there was Prissy, all dressed up, with flushed cheeks and shining
      eyes. She was all in a quiver of excitement, and looked ten years younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Priscilla Strong, you&rsquo;ve been expecting Stephen Clark here this evening!&rdquo;
       burst out Emmeline. &ldquo;You wicked, deceitful, underhanded, ungrateful
      creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she went on storming at Prissy, who began to cry, and looked so weak
      and babyish that I was frightened she would betray the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is between you and Prissy, Emmeline,&rdquo; I struck in, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not
      going to interfere. But I want to get you to come over and show me how to
      tuft my comfort that new pattern you learned in Avonlea, and as it had
      better be done before dark I wish you&rsquo;d come right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Emmeline ungraciously, &ldquo;but Priscilla shall come,
      too, for I see that she isn&rsquo;t to be trusted out of my sight after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hoped Stephen would see us from the garret window and make good his
      escape. But I didn&rsquo;t dare trust to chance, so when I got Emmeline safely
      to work on my comfort I excused myself and slipped out. Luckily my kitchen
      was on the off side of the house, but I was a nervous woman as I rushed
      across to the Strong place and dashed up Emmeline&rsquo;s garret stairs to
      Stephen. It was fortunate I had come, for he didn&rsquo;t know we had gone.
      Prissy had hidden him behind the loom and he didn&rsquo;t dare move for fear
      Emmeline would hear him on that creaky floor. He was a sight with cobwebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got him down and smuggled him into our barn, and he stayed there until
      it was dark and the Strong girls had gone home. Emmeline began to rage at
      Prissy the moment they were outside my door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Stephen came in and we talked things over. He and Prissy had made
      good use of their time, short as it had been. Prissy had promised to marry
      him, and all that remained was to get the ceremony performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that will be no easy matter,&rdquo; I warned him. &ldquo;Now that Emmeline&rsquo;s
      suspicions are aroused she&rsquo;ll never let Prissy out of her sight until
      you&rsquo;re married to another woman, if it&rsquo;s years. I know Emmeline Strong.
      And I know Prissy. If it was any other girl in the world she&rsquo;d run away,
      or manage it somehow, but Prissy never will. She&rsquo;s too much in the habit
      of obeying Emmeline. You&rsquo;ll have an obedient wife, Stephen&mdash;if you
      ever get her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephen looked as if he thought that wouldn&rsquo;t be any drawback. Gossip said
      that Althea had been pretty bossy. I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe it was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you suggest something, Rosanna?&rdquo; he implored. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve helped us so
      far, and I&rsquo;ll never forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only thing I can think of is for you to have the license ready, and
      speak to Mr. Leonard, and keep an eye on our ventilator,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      watch here and signal whenever there&rsquo;s an opening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, I watched and Stephen watched, and Mr. Leonard was in the plot, too.
      Prissy was always a favourite of his, and he would have been more than
      human, saint as he is, if he&rsquo;d had any love for Emmeline, after the way
      she was always trying to brew up strife in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Emmeline was a match for us all. She never let Prissy out of her
      sight. Everywhere she went she toted Prissy, too. When a month had gone
      by, I was almost in despair. Mr. Leonard had to leave for the Assembly in
      another week and Stephen&rsquo;s neighbours were beginning to talk about him.
      They said that a man who spent all his time hanging around the yard with a
      spyglass, and trusting everything to a hired boy, couldn&rsquo;t be altogether
      right in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw Emmeline driving away one day
      alone. As soon as she was out of sight I whisked over, and Anne Shirley
      and Diana Barry went with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were visiting me that afternoon. Diana&rsquo;s mother was my second cousin,
      and, as we visited back and forth frequently, I&rsquo;d often seen Diana. But
      I&rsquo;d never seen her chum, Anne Shirley, although I&rsquo;d heard enough about her
      to drive anyone frantic with curiosity. So when she came home from Redmond
      College that summer I asked Diana to take pity on me and bring her over
      some afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed in her. I considered her a beauty, though some
      people couldn&rsquo;t see it. She had the most magnificent red hair and the
      biggest, shiningest eyes I ever saw in a girl&rsquo;s head. As for her laugh, it
      made me feel young again to hear it. She and Diana both laughed enough
      that afternoon, for I told them, under solemn promise of secrecy, all
      about poor Prissy&rsquo;s love affair. So nothing would do them but they must go
      over with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the house amazed me. All the shutters were closed and
      the door locked. I knocked and knocked, but there was no answer. Then I
      walked around the house to the only window that hadn&rsquo;t shutters&mdash;a
      tiny one upstairs. I knew it was the window in the closet off the room
      where the girls slept. I stopped under it and called Prissy. Before long
      Prissy came and opened it. She was so pale and woe-begone looking that I
      pitied her with all my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prissy, where has Emmeline gone?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down to Avonlea to see the Roger Pyes. They&rsquo;re sick with measles, and
      Emmeline couldn&rsquo;t take me because I&rsquo;ve never had measles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Prissy! She had never had anything a body ought to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you just come and unfasten a shutter, and come right over to my
      house,&rdquo; I said exultantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have Stephen and the minister here in no
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;Em&rsquo;line has locked me in here,&rdquo; said Prissy woefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was posed. No living mortal bigger than a baby could have got in or out
      of that closet window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said finally, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the signal up for Stephen anyhow, and
      we&rsquo;ll see what can be done when he gets here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know how I was ever to get the signal up on that ventilator, for
      it was one of the days I take dizzy spells; and if I took one up on the
      ladder there&rsquo;d probably be a funeral instead of a wedding. But Anne
      Shirley said she&rsquo;d put it up for me, and she did. I had never seen that
      girl before, and I&rsquo;ve never seen her since, but it&rsquo;s my opinion that there
      wasn&rsquo;t much she couldn&rsquo;t do if she made up her mind to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen wasn&rsquo;t long in getting there and he brought the minister with him.
      Then we all, including Thomas&mdash;who was beginning to get interested in
      the affair in spite of himself&mdash;went over and held council of war
      beneath the closet window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas suggested breaking in doors and carrying Prissy off boldly, but I
      could see that Mr. Leonard looked very dubious over that, and even Stephen
      said he thought it could only be done as a last resort. I agreed with him.
      I knew Emmeline Strong would bring an action against him for housebreaking
      as likely as not. She&rsquo;d be so furious she&rsquo;d stick at nothing if we gave
      her any excuse. Then Anne Shirley, who couldn&rsquo;t have been more excited if
      she was getting married herself, came to the rescue again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you put a ladder up to the closet window,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;And Mr.
      Clark can go up it and they can be married there. Can&rsquo;t they, Mr.
      Leonard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard agreed that they could. He was always the most saintly looking
      man, but I know I saw a twinkle in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas, go over and bring our little ladder over here,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas forgot he was an elder, and he brought the ladder as quick as it
      was possible for a fat man to do it. After all it was too short to reach
      the window, but there was no time to go for another. Stephen went up to
      the top of it, and he reached up and Prissy reached down, and they could
      just barely clasp hands so. I shall never forget the look of Prissy. The
      window was so small she could only get her head and one arm out of it.
      Besides, she was almost frightened to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard stood at the foot of the ladder and married them. As a rule,
      he makes a very long and solemn thing of the marriage ceremony, but this
      time he cut out everything that wasn&rsquo;t absolutely necessary; and it was
      well that he did, for just as he pronounced them man and wife, Emmeline
      drove into the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew perfectly well what had happened when she saw the minister with
      his blue book in his hand. Never a word said she. She marched to the front
      door, unlocked it, and strode upstairs. I&rsquo;ve always been convinced it was
      a mercy that closet window was so small, or I believe that she would have
      thrown Prissy out of it. As it was, she walked her downstairs by the arm
      and actually flung her at Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, take your wife,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll pack up every stitch she owns
      and send it after her; and I never want to see her or you again as long as
      I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned to me and Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you that have aided and abetted that weakminded fool in this, take
      yourselves out of my yard and never darken my door again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness, who wants to, you old spitfire?&rdquo; said Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t just the thing for him to say, perhaps, but we are all human,
      even elders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls didn&rsquo;t escape. Emmeline looked daggers at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be something for you to carry back to Avonlea,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
      gossips down there will have enough to talk about for a spell. That&rsquo;s all
      you ever go out of Avonlea for&mdash;just to fetch and carry tales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finally she finished up with the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the Baptist church in Spencervale after this,&rdquo; she said. Her
      tone and look said a hundred other things. She whirled into the house and
      slammed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leonard looked around on us with a pitying smile as Stephen put poor,
      half-fainting Prissy into the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he said in that gently, saintly way of his, &ldquo;for the
      Baptists.&rdquo;

      XI. The Miracle at Carmody
    </h2>
    <p>
      Salome looked out of the kitchen window, and a pucker of distress appeared
      on her smooth forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear, what has Lionel Hezekiah been doing now?&rdquo; she murmured
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily she reached out for her crutch; but it was a little beyond
      her reach, having fallen on the floor, and without it Salome could not
      move a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway, Judith is bringing him in as fast as she can,&rdquo; she
      reflected. &ldquo;He must have been up to something terrible this time; for she
      looks very cross, and she never walks like that unless she is angry clear
      through. Dear me, I am sometimes tempted to think that Judith and I made a
      mistake in adopting the child. I suppose two old maids don&rsquo;t know much
      about bringing up a boy properly. But he is NOT a bad child, and it really
      seems to me that there must be some way of making him behave better if we
      only knew what it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salome&rsquo;s monologue was cut short by the entrance of her sister Judith,
      holding Lionel Hezekiah by his chubby wrist with a determined grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judith Marsh was ten years older than Salome, and the two women were as
      different in appearance as night and day. Salome, in spite of her
      thirty-five years, looked almost girlish. She was small and pink and
      flower-like, with little rings of pale golden hair clustering all over her
      head in a most unspinster-like fashion, and her eyes were big and blue,
      and mild as a dove&rsquo;s. Her face was perhaps a weak one, but it was very
      sweet and appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judith Marsh was tall and dark, with a plain, tragic face and iron-gray
      hair. Her eyes were black and sombre, and every feature bespoke unyielding
      will and determination. Just now she looked, as Salome had said, &ldquo;angry
      clear through,&rdquo; and the baleful glances she cast on the small mortal she
      held would have withered a more hardened criminal than six happy-go-lucky
      years had made of Lionel Hezekiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel Hezekiah, whatever his shortcomings, did not look bad. Indeed, he
      was as engaging an urchin as ever beamed out on a jolly good world through
      a pair of big, velvet-brown eyes. He was chubby and firm-limbed, with a
      mop of beautiful golden curls, which were the despair of his heart and the
      pride and joy of Salome&rsquo;s; and his round face was usually a lurking-place
      for dimples and smiles and sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just now Lionel Hezekiah was under a blight; he had been caught
      red-handed in guilt, and was feeling much ashamed of himself. He hung his
      head and squirmed his toes under the mournful reproach in Salome&rsquo;s eyes.
      When Salome looked at him like that, Lionel Hezekiah always felt that he
      was paying more for his fun than it was worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose I caught him doing this time?&rdquo; demanded Judith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; faltered Salome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Firing&mdash;at&mdash;a&mdash;mark&mdash;on&mdash;the&mdash;henhouse&mdash;door&mdash;with&mdash;new-laid&mdash;eggs,&rdquo;
       said Judith with measured distinctness. &ldquo;He has broken every egg that was
      laid to-day except three. And as for the state of that henhouse door&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judith paused, with an indignant gesture meant to convey that the state of
      the henhouse door must be left to Salome&rsquo;s imagination, since the English
      language was not capable of depicting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lionel Hezekiah, why will you do such things?&rdquo; said Salome miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t know it was wrong,&rdquo; said Lionel Hezekiah, bursting into
      prompt tears. &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought it would be bully fun. Seems&rsquo;s if
      everything what&rsquo;s fun &lsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salome&rsquo;s heart was not proof against tears, as Lionel Hezekiah very well
      knew. She put her arm about the sobbing culprit, and drew him to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know it was wrong,&rdquo; she said defiantly to Judith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got to be taught, then,&rdquo; was Judith&rsquo;s retort. &ldquo;No, you needn&rsquo;t try
      to beg him off, Salome. He shall go right to bed without supper, and stay
      there till to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! not without his supper,&rdquo; entreated Salome. &ldquo;You&mdash;you won&rsquo;t
      improve the child&rsquo;s morals by injuring his stomach, Judith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without his supper, I say,&rdquo; repeated Judith inexorably. &ldquo;Lionel Hezekiah,
      go up-stairs to the south room, and go to bed at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lionel Hezekiah went up-stairs, and went to bed at once. He was never
      sulky or disobedient. Salome listened to him as he stumped patiently
      up-stairs with a sob at every step, and her own eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t for pity&rsquo;s sake go crying, Salome,&rdquo; said Judith irritably. &ldquo;I
      think I&rsquo;ve let him off very easily. He is enough to try the patience of a
      saint, and I never was that,&rdquo; she added with entire truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t bad,&rdquo; pleaded Salome. &ldquo;You know he never does anything the
      second time after he has been told it was wrong, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good does that do when he is certain to do something new and twice
      as bad? I never saw anything like him for originating ideas of mischief.
      Just look at what he has done in the past fortnight&mdash;in one
      fortnight, Salome. He brought in a live snake, and nearly frightened you
      into fits; he drank up a bottle of liniment, and almost poisoned himself;
      he took three toads to bed with him; he climbed into the henhouse loft,
      and fell through on a hen and killed her; he painted his face all over
      with your water-colours; and now comes THIS exploit. And eggs at
      twenty-eight cents a dozen! I tell you, Salome, Lionel Hezekiah is an
      expensive luxury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we couldn&rsquo;t do without him,&rdquo; protested Salome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> could. But as you can&rsquo;t, or think you can&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll have to keep
      him, I suppose. But the only way to secure any peace of mind for
      ourselves, as far as I can see, is to tether him in the yard, and hire
      somebody to watch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some way of managing him,&rdquo; said Salome desperately. She
      thought Judith was in earnest about the tethering. Judith was generally so
      terribly in earnest in all she said. &ldquo;Perhaps it is because he has no
      other employment that he invents so many unheard-of things. If he had
      anything to occupy himself with&mdash;perhaps if we sent him to school&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too young to go to school. Father always said that no child should
      go to school until it was seven, and I don&rsquo;t mean Lionel Hezekiah shall.
      Well, I&rsquo;m going to take a pail of hot water and a brush, and see what I
      can do to that henhouse door. I&rsquo;ve got my afternoon&rsquo;s work cut out for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judith stood Salome&rsquo;s crutch up beside her, and departed to purify the
      henhouse door. As soon as she was safely out of the way, Salome took her
      crutch, and limped slowly and painfully to the foot of the stairs. She
      could not go up and comfort Lionel Hezekiah as she yearned to do, which
      was the reason Judith had sent him up-stairs. Salome had not been
      up-stairs for fifteen years. Neither did she dare to call him out on the
      landing, lest Judith return. Besides, of course he must be punished; he
      had been very naughty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wish I could smuggle a bit of supper up to him,&rdquo; she mused, sitting
      down on the lowest step and listening. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear a sound. I suppose he
      has cried himself to sleep, poor, dear baby. He certainly is dreadfully
      mischievous; but it seems to me that it shows an investigating turn of
      mind, and if it could only be directed into the proper channels&mdash;I
      wish Judith would let me have a talk with Mr. Leonard about Lionel
      Hezekiah. I wish Judith didn&rsquo;t hate ministers so. I don&rsquo;t mind so much her
      not letting me go to church, because I&rsquo;m so lame that it would be painful
      anyhow; but I&rsquo;d like to talk with Mr. Leonard now and then about some
      things. I can never believe that Judith and father were right; I am sure
      they were not. There is a God, and I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s terribly wicked not to
      go to church. But there, nothing short of a miracle would convince Judith;
      so there is no use in thinking about it. Yes, Lionel Hezekiah must have
      gone to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salome pictured him so, with his long, curling lashes brushing his rosy,
      tear-stained cheek and his chubby fists clasped tightly over his breast as
      was his habit; her heart grew warm and thrilling with the maternity the
      picture provoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year previously Lionel Hezekiah&rsquo;s parents, Abner and Martha Smith, had
      died, leaving a houseful of children and very little else. The children
      were adopted into various Carmody families, and Salome Marsh had amazed
      Judith by asking to be allowed to take the five-year-old &ldquo;baby.&rdquo; At first
      Judith had laughed at the idea; but, when she found that Salome was in
      earnest, she yielded. Judith always gave Salome her own way except on one
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want the child, I suppose you must have him,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;I
      wish he had a civilized name, though. Hezekiah is bad, and Lionel is
      worse; but the two in combination, and tacked on to Smith at that, is
      something that only Martha Smith could have invented. Her judgment was the
      same clear through, from selecting husbands to names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Lionel Hezekiah came into Judith&rsquo;s home and Salome&rsquo;s heart. The latter
      was permitted to love him all she pleased, but Judith overlooked his
      training with a critical eye. Possibly it was just as well, for Salome
      might otherwise have ruined him with indulgence. Salome, who always
      adopted Judith&rsquo;s opinions, no matter how ill they fitted her, deferred to
      the former&rsquo;s decrees meekly, and suffered far more than Lionel Hezekiah
      when he was punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat on the stairs until she fell asleep herself, her head pillowed on
      her arm. Judith found her there when she came in, severe and triumphant,
      from her bout with the henhouse door. Her face softened into marvelous
      tenderness as she looked at Salome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s nothing but a child herself in spite of her age,&rdquo; she thought
      pityingly. &ldquo;A child that&rsquo;s had her whole life thwarted and spoiled through
      no fault of her own. And yet folks say there is a God who is kind and
      good! If there is a God, he is a cruel, jealous tyrant, and I hate Him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judith&rsquo;s eyes were bitter and vindictive. She thought she had many
      grievances against the great Power that rules the universe, but the most
      intense was Salome&rsquo;s helplessness&mdash;Salome, who fifteen years before
      had been the brightest, happiest of maidens, light of heart and foot,
      bubbling over with harmless, sparkling mirth and life. If Salome could
      only walk like other women, Judith told herself that she would not hate
      the great tyrannical Power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel Hezekiah was subdued and angelic for four days after that affair of
      the henhouse door. Then he broke out in a new place. One afternoon he came
      in sobbing, with his golden curls full of burrs. Judith was not in, but
      Salome dropped her crochet-work and gazed at him in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lionel Hezekiah, what have you gone and done now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I just stuck the burrs in &lsquo;cause I was playing I was a heathen
      chief,&rdquo; sobbed Lionel Hezekiah. &ldquo;It was great fun while it lasted; but,
      when I tried to take them out, it hurt awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither Salome nor Lionel Hezekiah ever forgot the harrowing hour that
      followed. With the aid of comb and scissors, Salome eventually got the
      burrs out of Lionel Hezekiah&rsquo;s crop of curls. It would be impossible to
      decide which of them suffered more in the process. Salome cried as hard as
      Lionel Hezekiah did, and every snip of the scissors or tug at the silken
      floss cut into her heart. She was almost exhausted when the performance
      was over; but she took the tired Lionel Hezekiah on her knee, and laid her
      wet cheek against his shining head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lionel Hezekiah, what does make you get into mischief so constantly?&rdquo;
       she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lionel Hezekiah frowned reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he finally announced, &ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t send
      me to Sunday school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salome started as if an electric shock had passed through her frail body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Lionel Hezekiah,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;what put such and idea into your
      head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all the other boys go,&rdquo; said Lionel Hezekiah defiantly; &ldquo;and
      they&rsquo;re all better&rsquo;n me; so I guess that must be the reason. Teddy Markham
      says that all little boys should go to Sunday school, and that if they
      don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re sure to go to the bad place. I don&rsquo;t see how you can &lsquo;spect
      me to behave well when you won&rsquo;t send me to Sunday school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to go?&rdquo; asked Salome, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it bully,&rdquo; said Lionel Hezekiah frankly and succinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t use such dreadful words,&rdquo; sighed Salome helplessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
      what can be done. Perhaps you can go. I&rsquo;ll ask your Aunt Judith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aunt Judith won&rsquo;t let me go,&rdquo; said Lionel Hezekiah despondingly.
      &ldquo;Aunt Judith doesn&rsquo;t believe there is any God or any bad place. Teddy
      Markham says she doesn&rsquo;t. He says she&rsquo;s an awful wicked woman &lsquo;cause she
      never goes to church. So you must be wicked too, Aunt Salome, &lsquo;cause you
      never go. Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your&mdash;your Aunt Judith won&rsquo;t let me go,&rdquo; faltered Salome, more
      perplexed than she had ever been before in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that you have much fun on Sundays,&rdquo; remarked
      Lionel Hezekiah ponderingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have more if I was you. But I s&rsquo;pose you
      can&rsquo;t &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re ladies. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m a man. Look at Abel Blair, what
      splendid times he has on Sundays. He never goes to church, but he goes
      fishing, and has cock-fights, and gets drunk. When I grow up, I&rsquo;m going to
      do that on Sundays too, since I won&rsquo;t be going to church. I don&rsquo;t want to
      go to church, but I&rsquo;d like to go to Sunday school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salome listened in agony. Every word of Lionel Hezekiah&rsquo;s stung her
      conscience unbearably. So this was the result of her weak yielding to
      Judith; this innocent child looked upon her as a wicked woman, and, worse
      still, regarded old, depraved Abel Blair as a model to be imitated. Oh!
      was it too late to undo the evil? When Judith returned, Salome blurted out
      the whole story. &ldquo;Lionel Hezekiah must go to Sunday school,&rdquo; she concluded
      appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judith&rsquo;s face hardened until it was as if cut in stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he shall not,&rdquo; she said stubbornly. &ldquo;No one living in my household
      shall ever go to church or Sunday school. I gave in to you when you wanted
      to teach him to say his prayers, though I knew it was only foolish
      superstition, but I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t yield another inch. You know exactly how I
      feel on this subject, Salome; I believe just as father did. You know he
      hated churches and churchgoing. And was there ever a better, kinder, more
      lovable man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother believed in God; mother always went to church,&rdquo; pleaded Salome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother was weak and superstitious, just as you are,&rdquo; retorted Judith
      inflexibly. &ldquo;I tell you, Salome, I don&rsquo;t believe there is a God. But, if
      there is, He is cruel and unjust, and I hate Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judith!&rdquo; gasped Salome, aghast at the impiety. She half expected to see
      her sister struck dead at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;Judith&rsquo; me!&rdquo; said Judith passionately, in the strange anger that
      any discussion of the subject always roused in her. &ldquo;I mean every word I
      say. Before you got lame I didn&rsquo;t feel much about it one way or another;
      I&rsquo;d just as soon have gone with mother as with father. But, when you were
      struck down like that, I knew father was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Salome quailed. She felt that she could not, dare not, stand
      out against Judith. For her own sake she could not have done so, but the
      thought of Lionel Hezekiah nerved her to desperation. She struck her thin,
      bleached little hands wildly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judith, I&rsquo;m going to church to-morrow,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I tell you I am, I
      won&rsquo;t set Lionel Hezekiah a bad example one day longer. I&rsquo;ll not take him;
      I won&rsquo;t go against you in that, for it is your bounty feeds and clothes
      him; but I&rsquo;m going myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do, Salome Marsh, I&rsquo;ll never forgive you,&rdquo; said Judith, her harsh
      face dark with anger; and then, not trusting herself to discuss the
      subject any longer, she went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salome dissolved into her ready tears, and cried most of the night. But
      her resolution did not fail. Go to church she would, for that dear baby&rsquo;s
      sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judith would not speak to her at breakfast, and this almost broke Salome&rsquo;s
      heart; but she dared not yield. After breakfast, she limped painfully into
      her room, and still more painfully dressed herself. When she was ready,
      she took a little old worn Bible out of her box. It had been her mother&rsquo;s,
      and Salome read a chapter in it every night, although she never dared to
      let Judith see her doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she limped out into the kitchen, Judith looked up with a hard face. A
      flame of sullen anger glowed in her dark eyes, and she went into the
      sitting-room and shut the door, as if by that act she were shutting her
      sister for evermore out of her heart and life. Salome, strung up to the
      last pitch of nervous tension, felt intuitively the significance of that
      closed door. For a moment she wavered&mdash;oh, she could not go against
      Judith! She was all but turning back to her room when Lionel Hezekiah came
      running in, and paused to look at her admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look just bully, Aunt Salome,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use that word, Lionel Hezekiah,&rdquo; pleaded Salome. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
      church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me with you,&rdquo; said Lionel Hezekiah promptly. Salome shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, dear. Your Aunt Judith wouldn&rsquo;t like it. Perhaps she will let
      you go after a while. Now do be a good boy while I am away, won&rsquo;t you?
      Don&rsquo;t do any naughty things.&rdquo; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do them if I know they&rsquo;re naughty,&rdquo;
       conceded Lionel Hezekiah. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just the trouble; I don&rsquo;t know
      what&rsquo;s naughty and what ain&rsquo;t. Prob&rsquo;ly if I went to Sunday school I&rsquo;d find
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salome limped out of the yard and down the lane bordered by its asters and
      goldenrod. Fortunately the church was just outside the lane, across the
      main road; but Salome found it hard to cover even that short distance. She
      felt almost exhausted when she reached the church and toiled painfully up
      the aisle to her mother&rsquo;s old pew. She laid her crutch on the seat, and
      sank into the corner by the window with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had elected to come early so that she might get there before the rest
      of the people. The church was as yet empty, save for a class of Sunday
      school children and their teacher in a remote corner, who paused midway in
      their lesson to stare with amazement at the astonishing sight of Salome
      Marsh limping into church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big building, shadowy from the great elms around it, was very still. A
      faint murmur came from the closed room behind the pulpit where the rest of
      the Sunday school was assembled. In front of the pulpit was a stand
      bearing tall white geraniums in luxuriant blossom. The light fell through
      the stained-glass window in a soft tangle of hues upon the floor. Salome
      felt a sense of peace and happiness fill her heart. Even Judith&rsquo;s anger
      lost its importance. She leaned her head against the window-sill, and gave
      herself up to the flood of tender old recollections that swept over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memory went back to the years of her childhood when she had sat in this
      pew every Sunday with her mother. Judith had come then, too, always
      seeming grown up to Salome by reason of her ten years&rsquo; seniority. Her
      tall, dark, reserved father never came. Salome knew that the Carmody
      people called him an infidel, and looked upon him as a very wicked man.
      But he had not been wicked; he had been good and kind in his own odd way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentle little mother had died when Salome was ten years old, but so
      loving and tender was Judith&rsquo;s care that the child did not miss anything
      out of her life. Judith Marsh loved her little sister with an intensity
      that was maternal. She herself was a plain, repellent girl, liked by few,
      sought after by no man; but she was determined that Salome should have
      everything that she had missed&mdash;admiration, friendship, love. She
      would have a vicarious youth in Salome&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went according to Judith&rsquo;s planning until Salome was eighteen, and
      then trouble after trouble came. Their father, whom Judith had understood
      and passionately loved, died; Salome&rsquo;s young lover was killed in a
      railroad accident; and finally Salome herself developed symptoms of the
      hip-disease which, springing from a trifling injury, eventually left her a
      cripple. Everything possible was done for her. Judith, falling heir to a
      snug little fortune by the death of the old aunt for whom she was named,
      spared nothing to obtain the best medical skill, and in vain. One and all,
      the great doctors failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judith had borne her father&rsquo;s death bravely enough in spite of her agony
      of grief; she had watched her sister pining and fading with the pain of
      her broken heart without growing bitter; but when she knew at last that
      Salome would never walk again save as she hobbled painfully about on her
      crutch, the smouldering revolt in her soul broke its bounds, and
      overflowed her nature in a passionate rebellion against the Being who had
      sent, or had failed to prevent, these calamities. She did not rave or
      denounce wildly; that was not Judith&rsquo;s way; but she never went to church
      again, and it soon became an accepted fact in Carmody that Judith Marsh
      was as rank an infidel as her father had been before her; nay, worse,
      since she would not even allow Salome to go to church, and shut the door
      in the minister&rsquo;s face when he went to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have stood out against her for conscience&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; reflected
      Salome in her pew self-reproachfully. &ldquo;But, O dear, I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll
      never forgive me, and how can I live if she doesn&rsquo;t? But I must endure it
      for Lionel Hezekiah&rsquo;s sake; my weakness has perhaps done him great harm
      already. They say that what a child learns in the first seven years never
      leaves him; so Lionel Hezekiah has only another year to get set right
      about these things. Oh, if I&rsquo;ve left it till too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the people began to come in, Salome felt painfully the curious
      glances directed at her. Look where she would, she met them, unless she
      looked out of the window; so out of the window she did look unswervingly,
      her delicate little face burning crimson with self-consciousness. She
      could see her home and its back yard plainly, with Lionel Hezekiah making
      mud-pies joyfully in the corner. Presently she saw Judith come out of the
      house and stride away to the pine wood behind it. Judith always betook
      herself to the pines in time of mental stress and strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salome could see the sunlight shining on Lionel Hezekiah&rsquo;s bare head as he
      mixed his pies. In the pleasure of watching him she forgot where she was
      and the curious eyes turned on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Lionel Hezekiah ceased concocting pies, and betook himself to the
      corner of the summer kitchen, where he proceeded to climb up to the top of
      the storm-fence and from there to mount the sloping kitchen roof. Salome
      clasped her hands in agony. What if the child should fall? Oh! why had
      Judith gone away and left him alone? What if&mdash;what if&mdash;and then,
      while her brain with lightning-like rapidity pictured forth a dozen
      possible catastrophes, something really did happen. Lionel Hezekiah
      slipped, sprawled wildly, slid down, and fell off the roof, in a
      bewildering whirl of arms and legs, plump into the big rain-water hogshead
      under the spout, which was generally full to the brim with rain-water, a
      hogshead big and deep enough to swallow up half a dozen small boys who
      went climbing kitchen roofs on a Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something took place that is talked of in Carmody to this day, and
      even fiercely wrangled over, so many and conflicting are the opinions on
      the subject. Salome Marsh, who had not walked a step without assistance
      for fifteen years, suddenly sprang to her feet with a shriek, ran down the
      aisle, and out of the door!
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man, woman, and child in the Carmody church followed her, even to
      the minister, who had just announced his text. When they got out, Salome
      was already half-way up her lane, running wildly. In her heart was room
      for but one agonized thought. Would Lionel Hezekiah be drowned before she
      reached him?
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the gate of the yard, and panted across it just as a tall,
      grim-faced woman came around the corner of the house and stood rooted to
      the ground in astonishment at the sight that met her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Salome saw nobody. She flung herself against the hogshead and looked
      in, sick with terror at what she might see. What she did see was Lionel
      Hezekiah sitting on the bottom of the hogshead in water that came only to
      his waist. He was looking rather dazed and bewildered, but was apparently
      quite uninjured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yard was full of people, but nobody had as yet said a word; awe and
      wonder held everybody in spellbound silence. Judith was the first to
      speak. She pushed through the crowd to Salome. Her face was blanched to a
      deadly whiteness; and her eyes, as Mrs. William Blair afterwards declared,
      were enough to give a body the creeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salome,&rdquo; she said in a high, shrill, unnatural voice, &ldquo;where is your
      crutch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salome came to herself at the question. For the first time, she realized
      that she had walked, nay, run, all that distance from the church alone and
      unaided. She turned pale, swayed, and would have fallen if Judith had not
      caught her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Dr. Blair came forward briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry her in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t all of you come crowding in, either.
      She wants quiet and rest for a spell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most of the people obediently returned to the church, their sudden
      loosened tongues clattering in voluble excitement. A few women assisted
      Judith to carry Salome in and lay her on the kitchen lounge, followed by
      the doctor and the dripping Lionel Hezekiah, whom the minister had lifted
      out of the hogshead and to whom nobody now paid the slightest attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salome faltered out her story, and her hearers listened with varying
      emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle,&rdquo; said Sam Lawson in an awed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Blair shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;There is no miracle about it,&rdquo; he said
      bluntly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all perfectly natural. The disease in the hip has evidently
      been quite well for a long time; Nature does sometimes work cures like
      that when she is let alone. The trouble was that the muscles were
      paralyzed by long disuse. That paralysis was overcome by the force of a
      strong and instinctive effort. Salome, get up and walk across the
      kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salome obeyed. She walked across the kitchen and back, slowly, stiffly,
      falteringly, now that the stimulus of frantic fear was spent; but still
      she walked. The doctor nodded his satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep that up every day. Walk as much as you can without tiring yourself,
      and you&rsquo;ll soon be as spry as ever. No more need of crutches for you, but
      there&rsquo;s no miracle in the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judith Marsh turned to him. She had not spoken a word since her question
      concerning Salome&rsquo;s crutch. Now she said passionately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It WAS a miracle. God has worked it to prove His existence for me, and I
      accept the proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old doctor shrugged his shoulders again. Being a wise man, he knew
      when to hold his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, put Salome to bed, and let her sleep the rest of the day. She&rsquo;s
      worn out. And for pity&rsquo;s sake let some one take that poor child and put
      some dry clothes on him before he catches his death of cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening, as Salome Marsh lay in her bed in a glory of sunset light,
      her heart filled with unutterable gratitude and happiness, Judith came
      into the room. She wore her best hat and dress, and she held Lionel
      Hezekiah by the hand. Lionel Hezekiah&rsquo;s beaming face was scrubbed clean,
      and his curls fell in beautiful sleekness over the lace collar of his
      velvet suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel now, Salome?&rdquo; asked Judith gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better. I&rsquo;ve had a lovely sleep. But where are you going, Judith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to church,&rdquo; said Judith firmly, &ldquo;and I am going to take Lionel
      Hezekiah with me.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XII. The End of a Quarrel
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nancy Rogerson sat down on Louisa Shaw&rsquo;s front doorstep and looked about
      her, drawing a long breath of delight that seemed tinged with pain.
      Everything was very much the same; the square garden was a charming
      hodge-podge of fruit and flowers, and goose-berry bushes and tiger lilies,
      a gnarled old apple tree sticking up here and there, and a thick cherry
      copse at the foot. Behind was a row of pointed firs, coming out darkly
      against the swimming pink sunset sky, not looking a day older than they
      had looked twenty years ago, when Nancy had been a young girl walking and
      dreaming in their shadows. The old willow to the left was as big and
      sweeping and, Nancy thought with a little shudder, probably as
      caterpillary, as ever. Nancy had learned many things in her twenty years
      of exile from Avonlea, but she had never learned to conquer her dread of
      caterpillars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is much changed, Louisa,&rdquo; she said, propping her chin on her
      plump white hands, and sniffing at the delectable odour of the bruised
      mint upon which Louisa was trampling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad; I was afraid to come back
      for fear you would have improved the old garden out of existence, or else
      into some prim, orderly lawn, which would have been worse. It&rsquo;s as
      magnificently untidy as ever, and the fence still wobbles. It CAN&rsquo;T be the
      same fence, but it looks exactly like it. No, nothing is much changed.
      Thank you, Louisa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louisa had not the faintest idea what Nancy was thanking her for, but then
      she had never been able to fathom Nancy, much as she had always liked her
      in the old girlhood days that now seemed much further away to Louisa than
      they did to Nancy. Louisa was separated from them by the fulness of
      wifehood and motherhood, while Nancy looked back only over the narrow gap
      that empty years make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t changed much yourself, Nancy,&rdquo; she said, looking admiringly
      at Nancy&rsquo;s trim figure, in the nurse&rsquo;s uniform she had donned to show
      Louisa what it was like, her firm, pink-and-white face and the the glossy
      waves of her golden brown hair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve held your own wonderfully well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said Nancy complacently. &ldquo;Modern methods of massage and cold
      cream have kept away the crowsfeet, and fortunately I had the Rogerson
      complexion to start with. You wouldn&rsquo;t think I was really thirty-eight,
      would you? Thirty-eight! Twenty years ago I thought anybody who was
      thirty-eight was a perfect female Methuselah. And now I feel so horribly,
      ridiculously young, Louisa. Every morning when I get up I have to say
      solemnly to myself three times, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re an old maid, Nancy Rogerson,&rsquo; to
      tone myself down to anything like a becoming attitude for the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you don&rsquo;t mind being an old maid much,&rdquo; said Louisa, shrugging
      her shoulders. She would not have been an old maid herself for anything;
      yet she inconsistently envied Nancy her freedom, her wide life in the
      world, her unlined brow, and care-free lightness of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I do mind,&rdquo; said Nancy frankly. &ldquo;I hate being an old maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get married, then?&rdquo; asked Louisa, paying an unconscious
      tribute to Nancy&rsquo;s perennial chance by her use of the present tense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that wouldn&rsquo;t suit me either. I don&rsquo;t want to be married. Do you
      remember that story Anne Shirley used to tell long ago of the pupil who
      wanted to be a widow because &lsquo;if you were married your husband bossed you
      and if you weren&rsquo;t married people called you an old maid?&rsquo; Well, that is
      precisely my opinion. I&rsquo;d like to be a widow. Then I&rsquo;d have the freedom of
      the unmarried, with the kudos of the married. I could eat my cake and have
      it, too. Oh, to be a widow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo; said Louisa in a shocked tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy laughed, a mellow gurgle that rippled through the garden like a
      brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Louisa, I can shock you yet. That was just how you used to say
      &lsquo;Nancy&rsquo; long ago, as if I&rsquo;d broken all the commandments at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do say such queer things,&rdquo; protested Louisa, &ldquo;and half the time I
      don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, dear coz, half the time I don&rsquo;t myself. Perhaps the joy of
      coming back to the old spot has slightly turned my brain, I&rsquo;ve found my
      lost girlhood here. I&rsquo;m NOT thirty-eight in this garden&mdash;it is a flat
      impossibility. I&rsquo;m sweet eighteen, with a waist line two inches smaller.
      Look, the sun is just setting. I see he has still his old trick of
      throwing his last beams over the Wright farmhouse. By the way, Louisa, is
      Peter Wright still living there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Louisa threw a sudden interested glance at the apparently placid
      Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married, I suppose, with half a dozen children?&rdquo; said Nancy
      indifferently, pulling up some more sprigs of mint and pinning them on her
      breast. Perhaps the exertion of leaning over to do it flushed her face.
      There was more than the Rogerson colour in it, anyhow, and Louisa, slow
      though her mental processes might be in some respects, thought she
      understood the meaning of a blush as well as the next one. All the
      instinct of the matchmaker flamed up in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said promptly. &ldquo;Peter Wright has never married. He
      has been faithful to your memory, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! You make me feel as if I were buried up there in the Avonlea
      cemetery and had a monument over me with a weeping willow carved on it,&rdquo;
       shivered Nancy. &ldquo;When it is said that a man has been faithful to a woman&rsquo;s
      memory it generally means that he couldn&rsquo;t get anyone else to take him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the case with Peter,&rdquo; protested Louisa. &ldquo;He is a good match,
      and many a woman would have been glad to take him, and would yet. He&rsquo;s
      only forty-three. But he&rsquo;s never taken the slightest interest in anyone
      since you threw him over, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t. He threw me over,&rdquo; said Nancy, plaintively, looking afar
      over the low-lying fields and a feathery young spruce valley to the white
      buildings of the Wright farm, glowing rosily in the sunset light when all
      the rest of Avonlea was scarfing itself in shadows. There was laughter in
      her eyes. Louisa could not pierce beneath that laughter to find if there
      were anything under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fudge!&rdquo; said Louisa. &ldquo;What on earth did you and Peter quarrel about?&rdquo; she
      added, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered,&rdquo; parried Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve never seen him since?&rdquo; reflected Louisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Has he changed much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, some. He is gray and kind of tired-looking. But it isn&rsquo;t to be
      wondered at&mdash;living the life he does. He hasn&rsquo;t had a housekeeper for
      two years&mdash;not since his old aunt died. He just lives there alone and
      cooks his own meals. I&rsquo;ve never been in the house, but folks say the
      disorder is something awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shouldn&rsquo;t think Peter was cut out for a tidy housekeeper,&rdquo; said
      Nancy lightly, dragging up more mint. &ldquo;Just think, Louisa, if it hadn&rsquo;t
      been for that old quarrel I might be Mrs. Peter Wright at this very
      moment, mother to the aforesaid supposed half dozen, and vexing my soul
      over Peter&rsquo;s meals and socks and cows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you are better off as you are,&rdquo; said Louisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Nancy looked up at the white house on the hill again.
      &ldquo;I have an awfully good time out of life, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to satisfy,
      somehow. To be candid&mdash;and oh, Louisa, candour is a rare thing among
      women when it comes to talking of the men&mdash;I believe I&rsquo;d rather be
      cooking Peter&rsquo;s meals and dusting his house. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind his bad
      grammar now. I&rsquo;ve learned one or two valuable little things out yonder,
      and one is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if a man&rsquo;s grammar is askew, so long as
      he doesn&rsquo;t swear at you. By the way, is Peter as ungrammatical as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Louisa helplessly. &ldquo;I never knew he WAS
      ungrammatical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he still say, &lsquo;I seen,&rsquo; and &lsquo;them things&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never noticed,&rdquo; confessed Louisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enviable Louisa! Would that I had been born with that blessed faculty of
      never noticing! It stands a woman in better stead than beauty or brains.
      <i>I</i> used to notice Peter&rsquo;s mistakes. When he said &lsquo;I seen,&rsquo; it jarred
      on me in my salad days. I tried, oh, so tactfully, to reform him in that
      respect. Peter didn&rsquo;t like being reformed&mdash;the Wrights always had a
      fairly good opinion of themselves, you know. It was really over a question
      of syntax we quarrelled. Peter told me I&rsquo;d have to take him as he was,
      grammar and all, or go without him. I went without him&mdash;and ever
      since I&rsquo;ve been wondering if I were really sorry, or if it were merely a
      pleasantly sentimental regret I was hugging to my heart. I daresay it&rsquo;s
      the latter. Now, Louisa, I see the beginning of the plot far down in those
      placid eyes of yours. Strangle it at birth, dear Louisa. There is no use
      in your trying to make up a match between Peter and me now&mdash;no, nor
      in slyly inviting him up here to tea some evening, as you are even this
      moment thinking of doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must go and milk the cows,&rdquo; gasped Louisa, rather glad to make
      her escape. Nancy&rsquo;s power of thought-reading struck her as uncanny. She
      felt afraid to remain with her cousin any longer, lest Nancy should drag
      to light all the secrets of her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy sat long on the steps after Louisa had gone&mdash;sat until the
      night came down, darkly and sweetly, over the garden, and the stars
      twinkled out above the firs. This had been her home in girlhood. Here she
      had lived and kept house for her father. When he died, Curtis Shaw, newly
      married to her cousin Louisa, bought the farm from her and moved in. Nancy
      stayed on with them, expecting soon to go to a home of her own. She and
      Peter Wright were engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came their mysterious quarrel, concerning the cause of which kith and
      kin on both sides were left in annoying ignorance. Of the results they
      were not ignorant. Nancy promptly packed up and left Avonlea seven hundred
      miles behind her. She went to a hospital in Montreal and studied nursing.
      In the twenty years that followed she had never even revisited Avonlea.
      Her sudden descent on it this summer was a whim born of a moment&rsquo;s
      homesick longing for this same old garden. She had not thought about
      Peter. In very truth, she had thought little about Peter for the last
      fifteen years. She supposed that she had forgotten him. But now, sitting
      on the old doorstep, where she had often sat in her courting days, with
      Peter lounging on a broad stone at her feet, something tugged at her
      heartstrings. She looked over the valley to the light in the kitchen of
      the Wright farmhouse, and pictured Peter sitting there, lonely and uncared
      for, with naught but the cold comfort of his own providing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he should have got married,&rdquo; she said snappishly. &ldquo;I am not going
      to worry because he is a lonely old bachelor when all these years I have
      supposed him a comfy Benedict. Why doesn&rsquo;t he hire him a housekeeper, at
      least? He can afford it; the place looks prosperous. Ugh! I&rsquo;ve a fat bank
      account, and I&rsquo;ve seen almost everything in the world worth seeing; but
      I&rsquo;ve got several carefully hidden gray hairs and a horrible conviction
      that grammar isn&rsquo;t one of the essential things in life after all. Well,
      I&rsquo;m not going to moon out here in the dew any longer. I&rsquo;m going in to read
      the smartest, frilliest, frothiest society novel in my trunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the week that followed Nancy enjoyed herself after her own fashion. She
      read and swung in the garden, having a hammock hung under the firs. She
      went far afield, in rambles to woods and lonely uplands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it much better than meeting people,&rdquo; she said, when Louisa
      suggested going to see this one and that one, &ldquo;especially the Avonlea
      people. All my old chums are gone, or hopelessly married and changed, and
      the young set who have come up know not Joseph, and make me feel
      uncomfortably middle-aged. It&rsquo;s far worse to feel middle-aged than old,
      you know. Away there in the woods I feel as eternally young as Nature
      herself. And oh, it&rsquo;s so nice not having to fuss with thermometers and
      temperatures and other people&rsquo;s whims. Let me indulge my own whims, Louisa
      dear, and punish me with a cold bite when I come in late for meals. I&rsquo;m
      not even going to church again. It was horrible there yesterday. The
      church is so offensively spick-and-span brand new and modern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s thought to be the prettiest church in these parts,&rdquo; protested
      Louisa, a little sorely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Churches shouldn&rsquo;t be pretty&mdash;they should at least be fifty years
      old and mellowed into beauty. New churches are an abomination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see Peter Wright in church?&rdquo; asked Louisa. She had been bursting
      to ask it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verily, yes. He sat right across from me in the corner pew. I didn&rsquo;t
      think him painfully changed. Iron-gray hair becomes him. But I was
      horribly disappointed in myself. I had expected to feel at least a
      romantic thrill, but all I felt was a comfortable interest, such as I
      might have taken in any old friend. Do my utmost, Louisa, I couldn&rsquo;t
      compass a thrill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he come to speak to you?&rdquo; asked Louisa, who hadn&rsquo;t any idea what
      Nancy meant by her thrills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, no. It wasn&rsquo;t my fault. I stood at the door outside with the most
      amiable expression I could assume, but Peter merely sauntered away without
      a glance in my direction. It would be some comfort to my vanity if I could
      believe it was on account of rankling spite or pride. But the honest
      truth, dear Weezy, is that it looked to me exactly as if he never thought
      of it. He was more interested in talking about the hay crop with Oliver
      Sloane&mdash;who, by the way, is more Oliver Sloaneish than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel as you said you did the other night, why didn&rsquo;t you go and
      speak to him?&rdquo; Louisa wanted to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t feel that way now. That was just a mood. You don&rsquo;t know
      anything about moods, dearie. You don&rsquo;t know what it is to yearn
      desperately one hour for something you wouldn&rsquo;t take if it were offered
      you the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is foolishness,&rdquo; protested Louisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure it is&mdash;rank foolishness. But oh, it is so delightful to
      be foolish after being compelled to be unbrokenly sensible for twenty
      years. Well, I&rsquo;m going picking strawberries this afternoon, Lou. Don&rsquo;t
      wait tea for me. I probably won&rsquo;t be back till dark. I&rsquo;ve only four more
      days to stay and I want to make the most of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy wandered far and wide in her rambles that afternoon. When she had
      filled her jug she still roamed about with delicious aimlessness. Once she
      found herself in a wood lane skirting a field wherein a man was mowing
      hay. The man was Peter Wright. Nancy walked faster when she discovered
      this, with never a roving glance, and presently the green, ferny depths of
      the maple woods swallowed her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      From old recollections, she knew that she was on Peter Morrison&rsquo;s land,
      and calculated that if she kept straight on she would come out where the
      old Morrison house used to be. Her calculations proved correct, with a
      trifling variation. She came out fifty yards south of the old deserted
      Morrison house, and found herself in the yard of the Wright farm!
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing the house&mdash;the house where she had once dreamed of reigning
      as mistress&mdash;Nancy&rsquo;s curiosity overcame her. The place was not in
      view of any other near house. She deliberately went up to it intending&mdash;low
      be it spoken&mdash;to peep in at the kitchen window. But, seeing the door
      wide open, she went to it instead and halted on the step, looking about
      her keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen was certainly pitiful in its disorder. The floor had
      apparently not been swept for a fortnight. On the bare deal table were the
      remnants of Peter&rsquo;s dinner, a meal that could not have been very tempting
      at its best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a miserable place for a human being to live in!&rdquo; groaned Nancy.
      &ldquo;Look at the ashes on that stove! And that table! Is it any wonder that
      Peter has got gray? He&rsquo;ll work hard haymaking all the afternoon&mdash;and
      then come home to THIS!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An idea suddenly darted into Nancy&rsquo;s brain. At first she looked aghast.
      Then she laughed and glanced at her watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;just for fun and a little pity. It&rsquo;s half-past two, and
      Peter won&rsquo;t be home till four at the earliest. I&rsquo;ll have a good hour to do
      it in, and still make my escape in good time. Nobody will ever know;
      nobody can see me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy went in, threw off her hat, and seized a broom. The first thing she
      did was to give the kitchen a thorough sweeping. Then she kindled a fire,
      put a kettle full of water on to heat, and attacked the dishes. From the
      number of them she rightly concluded that Peter hadn&rsquo;t washed any for at
      least a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he just uses the clean ones as long as they hold out, and then
      has a grand wash-up,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I wonder where he keeps his
      dish-towels, if he has any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently Peter hadn&rsquo;t any. At least, Nancy couldn&rsquo;t find any. She marched
      boldly into the dusty sitting-room and explored the drawers of an
      old-fashioned sideboard, confiscating a towel she found there. As she
      worked, she hummed a song; her steps were light and her eyes bright with
      excitement. Nancy was enjoying herself thoroughly, there was no doubt of
      that. The spice of mischief in the adventure pleased her mightily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dishes washed, she hunted up a clean, but yellow and evidently long
      unused tablecloth out of the sideboard, and proceeded to set the table and
      get Peter&rsquo;s tea. She found bread and butter in the pantry, a trip to the
      cellar furnished a pitcher of cream, and Nancy recklessly heaped the
      contents of her strawberry jug on Peter&rsquo;s plate. The tea was made and set
      back to keep warm. And, as a finishing touch, Nancy ravaged the old
      neglected garden and set a huge bowl of crimson roses in the centre of the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I must go,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun to see Peter&rsquo;s face
      when he comes in, though? Ha-hum! I&rsquo;ve enjoyed doing this&mdash;but why?
      Nancy Rogerson, don&rsquo;t be asking yourself conundrums. Put on your hat and
      proceed homeward, constructing on your way some reliable fib to account to
      Louisa for the absence of your strawberries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy paused a moment and looked around wistfully. She had made the place
      look cheery and neat and homelike. She felt that queer tugging at her
      heart-strings again. Suppose she belonged here, and was waiting for Peter
      to come home to tea. Suppose&mdash;Nancy whirled around with a sudden
      horrible prescience of what she was going to see! Peter Wright was
      standing in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy&rsquo;s face went crimson. For the first time in her life she had not a
      word to say for herself. Peter looked at her and then at the table, with
      its fruit and flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy recovered herself. With a shame-faced laugh, she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have me arrested for trespass, Peter. I came and looked in at your
      kitchen out of impertinent curiosity, and just for fun I thought I&rsquo;d come
      in and get your tea. I thought you&rsquo;d be so surprised&mdash;and I meant to
      go before you came home, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised,&rdquo; said Peter, shaking hands. &ldquo;I saw you go
      past the field and I tied the horses and followed you down through the
      woods. I&rsquo;ve been sitting on the fence back yonder, watching your comings
      and goings.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come and speak to me at church yesterday,
      Peter?&rdquo; demanded Nancy boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid I would say something ungrammatical,&rdquo; answered Peter drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crimson flamed over Nancy&rsquo;s face again. She pulled her hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cruel of you, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter suddenly laughed. There was a note of boyishness in the laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I had to get rid of the accumulated malice and
      spite of twenty years somehow. It&rsquo;s all gone now, and I&rsquo;ll be as amiable
      as I know how. But since you have gone to the trouble of getting my supper
      for me, Nancy, you must stay and help me eat it. Them strawberries look
      good. I haven&rsquo;t had any this summer&mdash;been too busy to pick them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy stayed. She sat at the head of Peter&rsquo;s table and poured his tea for
      him. She talked to him wittily of the Avonlea people and the changes in
      their old set. Peter followed her lead with an apparent absence of
      self-consciousness, eating his supper like a man whose heart and mind were
      alike on good terms with him. Nancy felt wretched&mdash;and, at the same
      time, ridiculously happy. It seemed the most grotesque thing in the world
      that she should be presiding there at Peter&rsquo;s table, and yet the most
      natural. There were moments when she felt like crying&mdash;other moments
      when her laughter was as ready and spontaneous as a girl&rsquo;s. Sentiment and
      humour had always waged an equal contest in Nancy&rsquo;s nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Peter had finished his strawberries he folded his arms on the table
      and looked admiringly at Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look well at the head of a table, Nancy,&rdquo; he said critically. &ldquo;How is
      it that you haven&rsquo;t been presiding at one of your own long before this? I
      thought you&rsquo;d meet a lots of men out in the world that you&rsquo;d like&mdash;men
      who talked good grammar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Nancy, wincing. &ldquo;I was a goose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you were quite right. I was a tetchy fool. If I&rsquo;d had any sense, I&rsquo;d
      have felt thankful you thought enough of me to want to improve me, and I&rsquo;d
      have tried to kerrect my mistakes instead of getting mad. It&rsquo;s too late
      now, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late for what?&rdquo; said Nancy, plucking up heart of grace at something
      in Peter&rsquo;s tone and look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For&mdash;kerrecting mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grammatical ones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. I guess them mistakes are past kerrecting in an old fellow
      like me. Worse mistakes, Nancy. I wonder what you would say if I asked you
      to forgive me, and have me after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d snap you up before you&rsquo;d have time to change your mind,&rdquo; said Nancy
      brazenly. She tried to look Peter in the face, but her blue eyes, where
      tears and mirth were blending, faltered down before his gray ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter stood up, knocking over his chair, and strode around the table to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy, my girl!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
